# Colony Agent Work Queue — v0.13.0 Spec

**Status:** Draft for review  
**Supersedes:** `2026-05-19-agent-driven-initiative-delivery-v0.12.0.md` (v0.12.0 has critical architectural errors; this doc replaces it)  
**Author:** the agent (autonomous agent review)  
**Date:** 2026-05-20

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Goal:** Enable Colony to dispatch initiatives to external agents (e.g., the agent/Hermes) for background autonomous execution, while fixing existing bugs that cause initiatives to be lost, duplicated, or silently dropped.

**Critical discovery:** Colony ALREADY has a full distributed task queue with capability matching, heartbeats, retries, and dependency management. We will leverage this infrastructure instead of reinventing it.

**Two delivery paths:**

1. **Background Agent Execution** — Colony posts actionable initiatives as Jobs to the distributed task queue. the agent (as a SOVEREIGN mesh node) claims jobs matching her capabilities, executes them with tools, reports results. You only hear from me when:
   - The task failed and needs your input
   - The result exceeds an escalation threshold
   - A digest window expires (e.g., "here's what I did while you were away")

2. **In-Session Injection** — When you ARE actively messaging me, pending initiatives flow into the conversation via the existing `colony-memory` provider `prefetch()` path. No new hooks needed.

**Key principle:** Colony proposes, agent decides, agent acts. The agent (me) is the executive — not a relay that blindly messages you.

---

## 2. Colony's Existing Task Queue (Leveraged, Not Reinvented)

Colony already has (`sidecar/colony_sidecar/task_queue/`):

- **`Job`** — Full lifecycle: QUEUED → CLAIMED → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED/ABANDONED
- **`WorkerCapabilities`** — Hardware/software capabilities with `can_accept()` and `affinity_score()`
- **`QueueManager`** — Persistent SQLite queue with atomic claim, WAL mode, audit trails
- **`Scheduler`** — Priority-aware, capability-matching assignment on the Sovereign node
- **`WorkerNode`** — Polls for jobs, executes handlers, sends heartbeats
- **`QueueMeshEventHandler`** — Handles node death, role changes, job redistribution

**What we ADD:**
- Register the agent as a SOVEREIGN mesh node with capabilities (terminal, file, web, browser, git, etc.)
- Post `agent_action` initiatives as Jobs to the existing queue
- New API endpoints for external agents to claim/complete jobs
- the agent-side cron job that polls Colony's job queue

**What we DO NOT build:**
- A new queue system — use the existing one
- A new scheduling algorithm — use the existing `Scheduler`
- A new heartbeat mechanism — use the existing `WorkerNode` pattern

## 3. Bug Fixes (Existing Poor Implementations)

### 3.1 Dedup cooldown is completely broken
**Location:** `sidecar/colony_sidecar/intelligence/components/initiative_engine.py:1069-1092`

```python
# BUG: self._goal_store.list_recent() does not exist on any goal store.
# The AttributeError is swallowed by "except Exception: pass" every tick.
# Result: cooldown never works; same initiative is generated repeatedly.
recent = self._goal_store.list_recent(
    entity_type="initiative",
    entity_id=entity_id,
    hours=cooldown_tasks,
)
```

**Fix:** Replace with `initiative_store.list()` query on the actual SQLite store. The initiative store has `list(type=..., created_after=...)` — use that. Also remove the bare `except Exception: pass` — log the actual error.

### 3.2 Initiatives are never persisted to the store
**Location:** `sidecar/colony_sidecar/autonomy/loop.py:520-604` (`_phase_execute`)

The loop calls `delivery.push_initiative(payload)` directly. The bridge keeps items in an in-memory `_pending` list. On sidecar restart, all pending initiatives are lost. The SQLite `initiative_store` exists but is never written to during normal flow.

**Fix:** `_phase_execute` must `initiative_store.create(...)` for every initiative before dispatching. For agent_action initiatives, also `queue_manager.post(job)` to the task queue.

### 3.3 IN_SESSION items are consumed on read
**Location:** `sidecar/colony_sidecar/delivery/bridge.py:408-426`

`get_in_session_context()` sets `d.sent = True` immediately upon returning items. If the agent ignores the injected context, the initiative vanishes forever.

**Fix:** Do NOT mark as sent. Mark as sent only when the agent explicitly acknowledges via `POST /v1/host/initiatives/{id}/acknowledge` or when a 24h timeout expires.

### 3.4 Bridge `push_initiative` is memory-only
**Location:** `sidecar/colony_sidecar/delivery/bridge.py:243-375`

`push_initiative()` builds a webhook payload and POSTs it. It never calls `initiative_store.create()`. It also increments `stats.actions_executed` before confirming the webhook succeeded.

**Fix:**
- Call `initiative_store.create()` first with `status="pending"`
- Only increment stats and log success after HTTP 202 from webhook
- On webhook failure, update store status to `failed` with reason

### 3.5 Hardcoded owner name
**Location:** `sidecar/colony_sidecar/autonomy/loop.py:684`

```python
host_id = os.environ.get("COLONY_HOST_CONTACT_ID", "owner")
```

**Fix:** Remove the default. If the env var is unset, log a warning and skip the feed.

### 3.6 `record_push()` counts before confirming success
**Location:** `sidecar/colony_sidecar/autonomy/loop.py:578-583`

The loop increments `actions_executed` and `actions_this_hour` after `delivery.push_initiative()` returns `True`, but `push_initiative` returns `True` on HTTP 202 AND on some failure paths. Verify and fix: only count on confirmed delivery.

---

## 4. New Architecture: Agent Work Queue via Existing Task Queue

### 4.1 Node Registration

the agent registers as a SOVEREIGN node in the Colony mesh:

```python
from colony_sidecar.task_queue import WorkerCapabilities

caps = WorkerCapabilities(
    node_id="test-agent-hermes-01",
    capabilities={"terminal", "file", "web", "browser", "git", "python", "sqlite"},
    capacity={"cpu_cores": 8, "ram_gb": 16},
    max_concurrent=4,
    job_types={JobType.CUSTOM},  # Agent actions are CUSTOM type
)

await queue_manager.register_worker(caps)
```

### 4.2 Initiative → Job Mapping

When the initiative engine generates an `agent_action` initiative:

1. **Persist to initiative_store** — `status="pending"`, `type="agent_action"`
2. **Post to task queue** — Create a `Job` with:
   - `job_type = JobType.CUSTOM`
   - `payload = initiative dict` (description, context, escalation_threshold, etc.)
   - `capabilities = ["terminal"]` or whatever the action requires
   - `priority = scaled from initiative.priority (0-1 → 0-100)`
   - `timeout_secs = action-specific` (default 300s)
   - `tags = {"initiative_id": ..., "action_hint": ...}`
3. **Update initiative_store** — `status="queued"`, link to `job_id`

### 4.3 Agent Claiming and Execution

the agent polls the queue via cron (every 5 minutes):

```python
# In the agent's cron job
job = await queue_manager.claim_job("test-agent-hermes-01", the-agent_capabilities)
if job:
    # Execute with available tools
    result = await execute_with_tools(job.payload)
    await queue_manager.complete_job(job.job_id, "test-agent-hermes-01", result)
```

The existing `WorkerNode` pattern handles:
- Atomic claim (no double-assignment)
- Heartbeats (prevents abandonment)
- Timeout handling
- Retry on failure
- Audit trail

### 4.4 Destructive Operations Toggle

A new field in the initiative/job payload:

```python
"destructive": True/False  # default: True = require pre-approval
"approved_at": null         # set when owner approves
```

If `destructive=True` and `approved_at` is null:
- Job enters BLOCKED state (not QUEUED)
- Colony sends webhook to Hermes: "Approval required for X"
- I message you for approval
- On approval, job transitions to QUEUED and becomes claimable

**Default:** `destructive=True` (require approval). This applies to:
- Git push, force push
- File deletion outside of temp dirs
- System service restart
- Network configuration changes
- Database writes (if applicable)

Non-destructive ops (default `destructive=False`):
- Read-only queries (repo status, system health)
- Research/web search
- Test execution (in isolated env)
- File reads and analysis

### 4.5 Escalation and Digest

When a job completes, the agent decides whether to surface it:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `status == FAILED` | Message user immediately with error context |
| `priority >= 90` AND result is significant | Message user immediately |
| `priority >= 70` AND result is notable | Include in next digest |
| All others | Log silently, no message |

**Digest format:**

```
[Agent Update — 3 tasks completed]

✓ Checked colony-work CI — all green
✓ Updated 12 dependencies (2 security patches)
! Research on "vLLM speculative decoding" — found 3 relevant papers,
  draft summary ready if you want it

Nothing needs your attention right now.
```

Digest triggers:
- Every 4 hours of agent activity
- Immediately if any task escalates
- On user request (`show me what you've been doing`)

---

## 5. In-Session Injection (Corrected)

### 5.1 How It Actually Works (No pre_llm_call Needed)

The existing `colony-memory` provider already has `prefetch()` which calls `/v1/host/context/assemble`. Hermes injects the prefetch result into your message on every turn.

**Changes needed:**

1. **Colony:** Extend `/v1/host/context/assemble` to include `in_session_initiatives` in its response
2. **Provider:** Already formats and returns sections; no code change needed if the endpoint includes initiatives
3. **Result:** Pending initiatives appear in the injected `<memory-context>` block

### 5.2 Consumption Semantics (Fixed)

- Injected initiatives are NOT auto-consumed
- They remain in the delivery queue with `sent = False`
- The agent (me) sees them in context and decides whether to mention them
- If I mention an initiative in my response, Colony detects this and marks it consumed
- If I ignore it, it stays in queue and gets re-injected on the next turn (with dedup so it's not spammy)
- After 24h of being ignored, it escalates to a proactive message

### 5.3 Acknowledgment Detection

Colony monitors my responses for initiative acknowledgment. Patterns:
- Explicit: I call a `colony_acknowledge_initiative` tool with the initiative ID
- Implicit: My response text contains the initiative title/description in a way that addresses it
- Timeout: 24h without acknowledgment → escalate

## 6. API Changes Summary

### Colony Sidecar (New Endpoints in host.py)

The task queue exists but has NO API routes exposed. Add to `api/routers/host.py`:

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/v1/queue/jobs` | POST | Bearer | Post a new job to the queue |
| `/v1/queue/jobs/claim` | POST | Bearer | Atomically claim highest-priority eligible job |
| `/v1/queue/jobs/{id}/complete` | POST | Bearer | Report job completion |
| `/v1/queue/jobs/{id}/fail` | POST | Bearer | Report job failure |
| `/v1/queue/jobs/pending` | GET | Bearer | List pending jobs (for monitoring) |
| `/v1/queue/workers/register` | POST | Bearer | Register worker capabilities |
| `/v1/queue/workers/{id}/heartbeat` | POST | Bearer | Worker heartbeat |
| `/v1/initiatives/{id}/acknowledge` | POST | Bearer | Mark initiative as acknowledged |
| `/v1/initiatives/{id}/approve` | POST | Bearer | Approve a destructive initiative |

### Colony Sidecar (Modified)

| Component | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| `/v1/host/context/assemble` | Add `in_session_initiatives` to response |
| `autonomy/loop.py:_phase_execute` | Persist to initiative_store AND post agent_action jobs to task queue |
| `delivery/bridge.py:get_in_session_context` | Do NOT auto-consume; require explicit ack |
| `initiative_engine.py:generate` | Fix dedup to use initiative_store, not goal_store |

### Hermes Plugin (New Tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `colony_claim_task` | Claim highest-priority pending job from queue |
| `colony_complete_task` | Report job completion with results |
| `colony_fail_task` | Report job failure with error |
| `colony_acknowledge_initiative` | Explicitly mark an initiative as consumed |
| `colony_approve_initiative` | Approve a destructive initiative (transitions job to QUEUED) |

---

## 8. Multi-Agent Vision (Queen/Worker Architecture)

Colony's mesh model already defines:
- `NodeRole.SOVEREIGN` — The queen node with full brain capabilities
- `NodeRole.REGENT` — Backup brain, can assume sovereignty if needed
- `NodeRole.VASSAL` — Worker node, handles delegated tasks

**The owner's role:** SOVEREIGN — She is the primary external agent that the owner interacts with. She can:
- Claim and execute jobs from the task queue
- Post new jobs back to Colony for other workers
- Escalate to the owner when decisions are needed

**Future workers:** Additional VASSAL nodes can register with specific capabilities:
- A coding specialist node (claims `JobType.CUSTOM` with `capabilities={"code", "review"}`)
- A research node (claims `JobType.RESEARCH`)
- A monitoring node (claims `JobType.MONITORING`)

The existing `Scheduler` handles affinity-based assignment automatically. the agent posts jobs, the scheduler assigns them to the best worker, and results flow back.

**Worker capacity:** Each node advertises `max_concurrent` jobs. The scheduler respects this and won't over-assign. the agent's default: 4 concurrent jobs.

---

## 9. Migration Notes

- **No breaking changes to existing webhooks** — `/v1/delivery/pending` continues to work for gateway polling
- **Existing self-initiatives unchanged** — `subsystem_health`, `data_quality`, etc. still auto-execute via skills
- **initiative_store becomes source of truth** — bridge in-memory list becomes a cache, not the primary store
- **Task queue is additive** — Existing flows don't change; agent_action initiatives get a new path
- **Agent registration** — The agent identifies itself as `"test-agent-hermes-01"` (configurable via env var)

---

## 10. Design Decisions

### 10.1 Dynamic Capabilities — YES

the agent derives her advertised capabilities from the Hermes toolsets enabled in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

| Hermes Toolset | Colony Capability |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `terminal` | `terminal` |
| `file` | `file` |
| `web` | `web` |
| `browser` | `browser` |
| `git` (implicit via terminal) | `git` |
| `code_exec` | `code_execution` |

On cron startup, the agent reads her current toolsets, builds a `WorkerCapabilities` object, and registers (or re-registers) with Colony. If toolsets change, the next cron tick updates her capabilities. This prevents claiming jobs she cannot execute.

### 10.2 Job Type — Add `AGENT_ACTION`

Add `AGENT_ACTION` to the `JobType` enum in `task_queue/models.py`:

```python
class JobType(str, Enum):
    INFERENCE = "inference"
    TRAINING = "training"
    DATA_PROCESSING = "data_processing"
    SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE = "system_maintenance"
    RESEARCH = "research"
    MONITORING = "monitoring"
    SYNTHESIS = "synthesis"
    DESKTOP = "desktop"
    BROWSER = "browser"
    AGENT_ACTION = "agent_action"  # NEW
    CUSTOM = "custom"
```

**Why:** Semantically correct, avoids collision with other `CUSTOM` jobs, lets the scheduler filter/agent jobs separately. Backward-compatible because SQLite stores `job_type` as TEXT and the scheduler matches against worker `job_types` without validating against a fixed enum list.

### 10.3 Cross-Node Trust — Bearer Auth Now, Mesh Crypto Later

**Phase 1 (now):** Use the existing Bearer token auth for queue API endpoints. All nodes in the trusted local mesh share the same `COLONY_API_KEY`. Simple, works today, no crypto changes needed.

**Phase 2 (future):** When VASSAL workers are added and the mesh crypto is hardened (real keypairs instead of `f"sig-{uuid}"` placeholders), migrate to request signing:
- Each worker generates an Ed25519 keypair
- Signs `POST /v1/queue/jobs/claim` requests with its private key
- Sovereign verifies against the worker's registered public key in the mesh

This aligns with the existing `MeshNode.public_key` field and the Colony vision, but it is NOT a blocker for v0.13.0. The fake node certificate issue (TODOs.md #2) should be fixed as a separate security hardening effort.

---

## 11. Rejected Approaches (Documented for Posterity)

- **`pre_llm_call` hook injection** — Hermes hook signature doesn't support modifying system prompt or messages list. Returns string appended to user message only. Architecturally invalid for silent context injection.
- **Pure webhook-driven proactive messaging** — Creates orphan messages that bypass agent judgment. Agent becomes a relay, not an executive.
- **pre_llm_call + tool-based discovery hybrid** — Over-complicated. Prefetch path is simpler and already exists.
- **Building a new queue system** — Colony already has `QueueManager`, `Scheduler`, `WorkerNode`. Reinventing would be wasteful and fragment state.

*End of spec. Awaiting review before implementation.*
