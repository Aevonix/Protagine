# Changelog

## v0.30.1 — set a connector credential once

`ConnectorConfig` now resolves env-first, then the Colony encrypted secrets
store (`connector/<name>/<key>`), then the default. A credential like an IMAP
password or a private ICS URL is entered ONCE — `colony secrets set
connector/calendar/ics_url <url>` or `POST /v1/host/secrets/set` — lives
encrypted, survives service redeploys, and never has to be copied into a
plist or unit file. An explicit env var still always wins, and enable flags
work through the same path (restart to register a newly-enabled connector).

## v0.30.0 — gap closure: production-ready wiring

Every entry in docs/KNOWN-GAPS.md was prioritized and either fixed, wired
real, or retired with its reason recorded. Boundary rule applied throughout:
Colony is the cognitive substrate; sessions, tool execution, transport, and
cron belong to the host agent framework.

- **Goals unblock themselves**: `block_goal` accepts an external condition
  (`condition_type`/`condition_params`, also via `PATCH /goals/{id}`); the
  autonomy loop polls it at the condition's cadence and reactivates the goal
  when met. Concurrent-update safe, per-goal fault-isolated.
- **Briefings carry real content end-to-end**: anomaly, synthesis, and
  calendar aggregators join relationship + goals — detector-backed anomalies
  with honest severity labels, discoverer-backed cross-domain insights with
  dismissal filtering, and ICS-connector-backed calendar sections
  (chronologically correct across a week). Mind-model stays a stub on
  purpose: no real health source exists, and fabricated readiness numbers
  are worse than none.
- **World-model hygiene**: a real prune primitive (stale low-confidence
  entities; FK cascade + FTS-consistent; exact counts) on the config TTL
  knobs, and the daily task is back — doing the work it reports.
- **Self-knowledge grounding**: questions about Colony itself get the
  identity-bootstrap corpus injected into assembled context.
- **Retired**: ScheduleAdapter (contracts unimplementable on both ends;
  host-cron mutation crosses the framework boundary) and the orphaned
  EmailHandler (delivery is the host gateway's job). The
  `cognition.requested` spawn spec remains a host-plugin integration point
  by design.
- README refreshed (Mind track, resolution semantics, self-unblocking goals,
  briefing reality) and points to KNOWN-GAPS as the authoritative
  scaffolding-vs-live inventory.

## v0.29.0 — the honesty release: dead features wired real, fabricated statuses removed

A three-round audit (stub/marker sweep, correctness hunt, dead-wiring hunt,
then an adversarial re-review of the fixes themselves) across the sidecar and
plugins. Headline items:

- **Silently-dead features fixed**: active goals never reached assembled
  context (invalid kwarg swallowed by a broad except); the goals tool always
  errored (nonexistent method); open follow-ups never reached outreach
  evaluation (dict iterated as list); briefings composed every data section
  from stubs — permanently empty (relationship + goal aggregators now wired,
  new `GoalEngineAggregator`); the condition worker's system checks never ran
  (now an hourly loop phase — the pending→overdue flip actually fires).
- **Fabricated status removed**: five scheduler tasks were no-op lambdas
  reporting `ok` on their intervals forever. health_check and cpi_track now
  do real work; the rest are gone until their primitives exist
  (docs/KNOWN-GAPS.md).
- **/timeline actually shows recent activity**: the journal walk gained
  `newest_first`, and the cap's `hasMore` off-by-one and types-blindness are
  fixed.
- **Leaks plugged**: strong references for fire-and-forget tasks (mesh
  scheduler, world-model updates, recall touches), per-run neo4j driver
  closed in the research gatherer, world-LLM timeout capped under the tick
  budget (the "Unclosed client session" spam source), connector polls moved
  off the event loop, briefing push deadlock removed.
- **Boundary controls fail closed**: connector directive-blackout check no
  longer converts an internal error into permission.
- **`colony autonomy status|cycle`** now really talks to the running sidecar.
- **docs/KNOWN-GAPS.md**: an honest inventory of scaffolding that exists but
  is not wired, so status claims match reality.

## v0.28.0 — resolution that sticks: settlement, learning loop, agent tools

The headline bug: resolving an overdue-commitment concern from the command
center only settled the workspace concern; the commitment stayed open, the
next ingest tick re-raised it, and the owner's resolve was silently undone
minutes later. Resolution is now a first-class, cascading, learnable act:

- **Source settlement** (`self_model/settlement.py`): a concern raised from a
  durable source (`sources=["commitment:<id>", ...]`) settles that source when
  the concern is resolved. Registry-based — deployments wire settlers for the
  stores they run; a commitment settler ships wired.
- **Resolve with WHY**: outcome `done | invalid | duplicate | wont_do |
  obsolete` on the concern-resolve endpoint, `PATCH /commitments/{id}`, MCP
  fulfill/cancel, and the new Hermes tools. The resolution {outcome, note, by,
  at} is recorded on the commitment and emitted as an event.
- **Re-raise suppression**: a resolved concern's dedup_key is not re-raised
  while the resolution is fresh (`COLONY_WORKSPACE_RESOLVED_TTL_HOURS`,
  default 24), so a resolve sticks even against a still-open source.
- **Reverse cascade**: settling a commitment directly (agent tool, MCP, API)
  resolves any workspace concern raised from it.
- **Open-status model unified**: `get_overdue()` and per-person open-item
  queries include `overdue` rows; the pending→overdue flip no longer hides
  items from dedup lists, prompt sections, or workspace ingest (and the flip
  only fires once per item).
- **Extraction learning loop**: the per-turn introspection extractor now
  enforces dedup in code against open items AND recently rejected ones
  (cancelled as invalid/duplicate), and its prompt carries both lists.
  `GET /commitments/stats/resolution` exposes per-source outcome stats as the
  calibration signal. `POST /commitments` accepts `dedupe` to return an
  existing open twin instead of creating one.
- **Agent surface**: Hermes plugin tools `colony_list_commitments`,
  `colony_create_commitment` (dedupes), `colony_resolve_commitment` (with
  outcome + reason) — any Colony agent can generate AND resolve items and
  learns from what the owner rejects.
- Hermes plugin repo/live drift healed: initiatives-based task handlers and
  the `plugins.colony.autonomy_prompt` / `autonomy_deliver` deployment seam
  are now in-repo alongside the sender-attribution redesign.

## v0.27.1 — autonomy-loop hardening + operator controls

Fixes from live operation and the command-center build:
- The autonomy loop can no longer be frozen by a slow or hung phase: the
  whole tick is bounded (`COLONY_TICK_BUDGET_SECS`, default 80% of the tick
  interval), the toolsmith/workspace phases carry per-phase budgets, the
  toolsmith's Docker sandbox calls moved off the event loop
  (`asyncio.to_thread`), and the benchmark's recall probes are individually
  bounded. A cancelled tick is safe (phases re-run next cycle).
- New `fd-limit` doctor check reads the SIDECAR's own open-file limit from
  `/health` — a low limit (macOS default 256) silently breaks LanceDB vector
  recall with "Too many open files" and degrades recall to the slow keyword
  path; the check warns with the launchd/systemd/ulimit remedy.
- The workspace anomaly ingest read the wrong registry property and silently
  never fired; fixed with a regression test over all ingest sources.
- Expectations generate on every phase pass (create() dedups), so a newly
  due-dated commitment gets its prediction within a tick.
- `POST /v1/host/self/workspace/{id}/resolve`: owner control to settle a
  concern (the command center's concern action).


## v0.27.0 — expectation engine: predictions, surprise, calibration (Mind M3a)

The agent forms explicit predictions and checks them against reality. A
prediction carries a subject, a confidence, and a horizon; a checker
resolves each at its horizon through a pluggable resolver (one built-in for
commitments — "this gets fulfilled by its due date"). A miss becomes a
surprise that raises cognitive-workspace salience, the attention signal
worth thinking about; the hit/miss record produces a per-domain Brier
calibration score. That score finally sources the benchmark's calibration
metric (`calibration.<domain>`, expressed as accuracy = 1 - Brier so higher
is better), so "does she predict well, and is it improving" becomes a real
trend line. Predictions are generated from pending commitments, with
confidence set by the agent's own historical fulfillment rate.

New `colony_sidecar/self_model/expectations.py` (prediction store + engine
with a resolver registry). `GET /v1/host/self/expectations`, an autonomy
phase that generates hourly and checks every couple of ticks (linking the
workspace so surprises land), a `server-expectations` doctor check, and an
Expectations panel on the Operator Deck. Gated by `COLONY_EXPECTATIONS`
(off | shadow | live, default off).


## v0.26.0 — cognitive workspace: continuity of thought (Mind M2)

The agent now carries something on its mind between interactions instead of
only reacting. A bounded workspace holds active concerns
(question/goal/thread/anomaly/maintenance), each with a salience score that
live signals raise (overdue commitments, anomalies, benchmark regressions)
and time decays. A scheduler runs every few ticks: it decays the salience
field, evicts the floor and anything over capacity, and runs one bounded
thinking job on the most salient concern that still has budget. During a
configured nightly sleep window it thinks several times per pass, when the
cluster is idle. A thought either makes progress (salience sustained), gets
stuck (salience decays harder, so rumination fades on its own), or resolves
(the concern leaves the mind). In live mode a thought can surface an
initiative to the owner or propose a self-experiment, both through the
existing gates; in shadow it only thinks and journals.

New `colony_sidecar/self_model/workspace.py` (concern store + engine) and
`thinker.py` (the model-agnostic LLM reflection, injected so the engine is
testable). `GET /v1/host/self/workspace` exposes what is on her mind and
drives the Operator Deck's on-her-mind panel. Doctor check
`server-workspace`. Gated by `COLONY_WORKSPACE` (off | shadow | live,
default off), `COLONY_SLEEP_WINDOW`, and capacity/half-life/budget env.


## v0.25.0 — toolsmith: the agent builds its own tools (Mind M1)

Compounding capability. The agent now extends itself: a daily autonomy
phase mines the action journal for recurring procedures, the LLM drafts a
pure standard-library tool (source, input schema, and a self-contained
test), and the test runs inside the egress-none Docker sandbox as
verification. A tool that passes enters shadow, where re-running its test
accumulates clean runs; once it has enough and the toolsmith trust domain
allows, it graduates to live (owner-approved, or automatic once the domain
reaches act_first). Live tools are advertised to the reasoning loop through
a new dynamic-tool provider on the tool executor and run in the sandbox
when the model calls them. Tools that go unused or start failing retire
themselves.

New subsystem `colony_sidecar/toolsmith/` (persisted registry + journal
miner + engine), deliberately independent of the runtime `skills/`
executor registry. Composes the shipped Docker sandbox, trust engine,
action journal, and LLM router. Surfaces: `GET /v1/host/self/tools`,
`GET .../tools/{id}`, `POST .../tools/{id}/graduate`, `.../retire`; a
`server-toolsmith` doctor check. Gated by `COLONY_TOOLSMITH` (off | shadow
| live, default off) and requires the live Docker sandbox to verify and run
tools. Related env: `COLONY_TOOLSMITH_MIN_OCCURRENCES`,
`COLONY_TOOLSMITH_SHADOW_MIN`, `COLONY_TOOLSMITH_EXCLUDE_DOMAINS`.

Also fixed: `complete_job` now records a real duration (from claim time
when the caller omits started_at), so job-latency metrics measure actual
work; and the tool executor gained the dynamic-provider hook dynamic tools
need.


## v0.24.0 — selfhood benchmark + experiment framework (Mind M0)

Measurement before mechanism: the first phase of the cognition program.

**Selfhood benchmark.** A weekly scorecard derived entirely from existing
journals and stores; nothing is self-reported, and a metric whose source is
unavailable is skipped rather than zero-filled. Metrics: commitment
fulfillment, initiative acceptance (owner responded within 24h of a
delivery), delivery and per-domain action success, journal decision mix,
recall fact coverage (probe: high-confidence shared facts re-queried
against graph recall), queue job latency percentiles, and generic rollups
of host-submitted samples (`POST /v1/host/self/benchmark/samples`, e.g. a
voice gateway reporting TTFB). Surfaces: `GET /v1/host/self/benchmark`
(ISO-week rollups + week-over-week trends), `POST .../compute`,
`colony benchmark` CLI, a weekly autonomy phase that computes the previous
week and delivers the scorecard to the owner, and a `server-benchmark`
doctor check that WARNs on regressing non-latency trends.

**Experiment framework.** Self-modification as controlled experiments: one
bounded change per experiment (an adaptive-parameter variant), a captured
metric baseline, a decision window, and adopt-within-guard or auto-revert
on regression. Honest rules: no metric baseline, no experiment; a decision
requires a new completed rollup week; a knob moved outside the experiment
aborts as superseded and is never re-applied; one open experiment per
parameter plus a global running cap. `GET/POST /v1/host/self/experiments`,
`POST .../{id}/abort`, a daily decision phase with owner notices, every
transition journaled.

New env (all default-on, see .env.example): `COLONY_BENCHMARK_ENABLED`,
`COLONY_BENCHMARK_REPORT`, `COLONY_BENCHMARK_PROBES`,
`COLONY_EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED`, `COLONY_EXPERIMENTS_MAX_RUNNING`.


## v0.23.2 — owner contact curation (link / merge / review proposals)

Completes the relationship program's promised curation surface (it was
designed in docs/RELATIONSHIPS.md but never shipped): when the resolver
files a handle proposal, or you want to say "that WhatsApp is Sam's", or a
shadow contact turns out to be someone you know, there is now a way to act.

- `link_contact(who, gateway, address)` tool + `POST /contacts/{id}/handles`:
  attach a channel handle to a person, unifying their identity across
  channels.
- `merge_contacts(keep, merge)` tool + `POST /contacts/merge` + store method:
  fold one contact into another — reassigns handles, sums interaction
  history, soft-deletes the loser; audited on both records and reversible.
- `pending_contact_proposals` tool + `GET /contacts/proposals` + store
  `list_handle_proposals`: review the auto-proposed handle links from
  scoped-name attribution (rung 4 never links silently).

Tests: link/merge/proposal round-trips in test_relationships (incl. the
resolver filing a proposal that the store surfaces). Full suite 1707 passed.


## v0.23.1 — gap-sweep fixes: safety on the send path, whole comms ledger, honest surfaces

Fixes from a full-codebase gap audit. No new subsystems; closing holes.

- **Safety gate reaches the send path.** ResponseGuard now runs on the
  proactive delivery path (secret-leak / disclosure-tier / injection /
  provenance) before a message leaves — shadow logs, enforce
  (COLONY_GUARD_MODE=enforce) blocks. The request-path gate's L7 send-delay
  is env-tunable (COLONY_GATE_SEND_DELAY_SECS; 0 = pass-through, now
  explicit) and boot logs the secondary-review posture; L6 fail-open is
  documented at the config.
- **The comms ledger sees the whole conversation.** turns/sync now records
  the assistant's reply as an outbound exchange on the resolved contact +
  conversation channel (it logged inbound only), so reciprocity and
  last-contact-each-way — which the reachout recommendation depends on — are
  no longer starved. record-outreach skips placeholder contacts.
- **Research review gate actually runs.** The stage constructed ResponseGate
  with the wrong signature, threw every call, and silently degraded to a
  4-string scan; it now runs the real PII + injection layers on the
  artifact.
- **/jobs/completed and /jobs/blocked honor task_type** (the param was
  declared on completed but silently dropped; the query now filters and
  returns job_type).
- **Attribution hardening.** /tom/extract validates the contact like the
  affect/facts POSTs; the ParticipantResolver recognizes a canonical
  contact id passed as user_id (the voice channel) instead of minting a
  duplicate shadow; the wizard surfaces COLONY_IDENTITY_SHADOW_CONTACTS.
- **Chain/remote-agent surface flagged experimental.** No consensus loop
  runs and the remote handshake is not verified end to end; the connect
  cert is now really signed when a key manager is present (the
  sig-<uuid> placeholder is gone) and uses the field the verifier reads.
  docs/MULTI_AGENT.md and the boot log say what is supported vs
  experimental.


## v0.23.0 — relationship intelligence: one person, every channel

The relationship stack existed but attribution failed it: a live audit found
62% of communications filed under a `default` pseudo-contact, third parties
with zero history despite active group participation, and a psyche profile
faithfully built for a non-person. This release makes attribution the
foundation and turns the accumulated signals into actionable briefs. Full
spec: `docs/RELATIONSHIPS.md`.

- **Per-message sender attribution.** `turns/sync` accepts a `sender`
  (platform, user_id, display_name, group_id); the new ParticipantResolver
  resolves it server-side: exact/cross-gateway handle match (phones unify
  across sms/rcs/whatsapp/signal/imessage), scoped display-name (files a
  merge proposal, never links silently), or a shadow contact so strangers
  accrue history from first contact. The resolved contact drives everything
  downstream: interactions, comms ledger, affect, facts, engagement,
  introspection.
- **Machines are not people.** Senderless turns on machine channels
  (`COLONY_IDENTITY_MACHINE_CHANNELS`) or with system-origin text attribute
  to the reserved `system` sentinel: no interactions, no ToM writes, no
  psyche. The ToM APIs now validate contact ids against the store, so test
  strings can never mint affect/fact state again.
- **Comms provenance.** The ledger records the conversation's real
  channel_id (group vs DM vs voice) instead of the contact's primary-handle
  gateway.
- **RelationshipProfiler.** Composes standing (interactions, channels,
  cadence), psyche (the engagement extractor's OCEAN/style profile),
  affect trend, rapport topics, and derived approach guidance (preferred
  channel, best local hours, style notes, cautions) into a cached
  per-person brief: injected into context assembly for non-owner
  conversations, exposed as the `relationship_brief` tool and
  `GET /v1/host/relationships[/{id}]`, refreshed by a new autonomy phase.
- **Hermes provider** passes the per-turn sender through, making the
  sidecar authoritative even when client-side resolution misses.
- **Doctor**: new `relationship-attribution` check warns when recent
  communications pile onto placeholder contacts.


## v0.22.1 — directive capture safety, contacts path anchor, worker observability

Hardening release from live testing of v0.22.0 on the reference deployment.

- **Directive self-poisoning fixed.** Live testing surfaced a directive store
  where ~70 of 90 "boundaries" were machine-origin garbage (test canaries,
  the executor's own refusal text, anaphora fragments), and the worker
  governor enforced them against every routine job. Capture now rejects
  machine-origin text and degenerate fragment subjects, and never piles up
  duplicates (both the deterministic and LLM-assisted paths); the keyword
  matcher raises the single-term "distinctive" bar and never treats the
  product/agent name (or `COLONY_MATCH_COMMON_TERMS`) as a lone match signal.
  New `server-directives` doctor check flags fragments and duplicate piles.
- **Contacts DB default anchored to the state dir** (was CWD-relative, the
  same failure class as the world-model store incident); doctor detects the
  empty-stub-next-to-real-store env-mismatch signature.
- **colony-worker daemon output is line-buffered** (under launchd/systemd the
  log file stayed empty for hours); the launchd deploy template ships
  StandardOutPath/StandardErrorPath.
- README architecture flowchart rewritten in GitHub-compatible mermaid.


## v0.22.0 — the cognition program: earned autonomy, one-knob posture, closed learning loops

The seven-capability cognition program lands in full, alongside the autonomy preset, the
plugin consolidation, and a public-docs refresh. Colony is now a sidecar that can *earn*
agency rather than be granted it.

- **Self-model / trust engine:** graduated, earned autonomy per action class —
  `shadow → ask_first → act_first` — with confidence computed from real journaled outcomes,
  auto-graduation with owner notification, circuit breakers that demote on failures or any
  audit violation, and an immutable floor (money movement, irreversible deletion, credential
  changes, bulk third-party messaging) that is never self-decidable. Every gate decision is
  journaled in the unified ActionJournal (`colony-action-journal.db`), and the daily
  proactive-delivery cap adapts to the delivery domain's track record.
- **`COLONY_AUTONOMY_PRESET=passive|calibration|autonomous`:** one knob supplying defaults
  for all fourteen autonomy flags at once. Explicit env always wins; `calibration` (the
  wizard default) shadows everything and lets the trust engine graduate capability classes
  from their real track record; the sandbox never goes live from a preset.
  `GET /v1/host/autonomy/posture` returns the resolved posture of the running process.
- **Projects (`projects/`):** goal persistence and sustained multi-tick pursuit — a planner
  decomposes goals and the ProjectEngine advances them across autonomy cycles
  (`COLONY_PROJECTS_MODE`).
- **Skills memory (`skills_memory/`):** compounding procedure learning — distill on
  retry-success and novel diagnosis, retrieve into future prompts (`COLONY_SKILLS_DISTILL`).
- **Beliefs (`beliefs/`):** contradiction detection, resolution, and stale-belief decay
  (`COLONY_BELIEFS_MODE`).
- **Workers:** `task_queue/governor.py` WorkerGovernor enforces server-side — capability
  coverage, boundary compliance, and report audits are re-decided by the sidecar, never
  taken on the worker's word — and `workers/colony_worker.py` ships as the installable
  `colony-worker` daemon with systemd/launchd templates under `workers/deploy/`
  (`COLONY_WORKERS_MODE`).
- **Sandbox (`sandbox/`):** gated Docker exploration sandbox — no network, no credentials,
  capped resources, read-only rootfs (`COLONY_SANDBOX_MODE=off|dry_run|live`; live is
  explicit-only).
- **Connectors (`connectors/`):** read-only senses framework — `imap_email`,
  `caldav_calendar`, `fs_documents`, `webhook_pull` — feeding observations into the same
  cognition path (`COLONY_CONNECTORS_MODE` + per-connector `COLONY_CONNECTOR_<NAME>_*`).
- **Charter prompt architecture:** every LLM role shares one versioned agency doctrine
  (`cognition/charter.py`); the `PROMPT_VERSION` is journaled with every action.
- **Closed learning loops:** the new AdaptiveParamStore (`self_model/params.py`) holds
  bounded, journaled runtime knobs that consumers actually read back
  (`consolidation.similarity_threshold` [0.85–0.98], `recall.min_relevance` [0–0.5];
  `GET /v1/host/self/params`). The meta-learning StrategyAdjuster now writes THROUGH this
  store — previously it wrote a graph Config node nothing read, so the flagship
  self-improvement adjustment had zero effect. The initiative executor records wins/losses
  on the skills that informed each run and retrieval ranks by that record; trust confidence
  now consumes stated-vs-realized calibration, so overconfident domains earn less trust.
- **Mining (`mining/`):** escalation miner spots correction/consultation turns
  (`COLONY_ESCALATION_MINING`) and the training-corpus exporter
  (`POST /v1/host/mining/corpus/export`) writes fine-tune JSONL under the state dir only.
- **Feeds (`feeds/`):** spec-driven intelligence feed framework with the `colony feeds`
  CLI, `docs/FEEDS.md`, and the `plugins/feeds-manage` Hermes plugin.
- **Channels, persona, backup:** generic channel registration with auto-derived channel ids
  (`channels/`, `docs/CHANNEL_FRAMEWORK.md`), the persona deployment layer (`persona/`,
  `colony persona` CLI), and full-state backup/restore (`colony backup` / `colony restore`).
- **Doctor:** ten new cognition checks that read the RUNNING server — autonomy posture,
  self-model + breakers, adaptive params, executor, projects, beliefs, worker governor,
  sandbox, connectors, mining — plus env-mismatch detection on contacts-db; 30 check
  results in a full run.
- **Wizard:** preset-driven autonomy step; OpenClaw fully removed (menu, flags, validate
  path — support was removed in v0.21.14 but the wizard still offered it and silently
  no-opped); `colony validate` now live-fires the sidecar's own LLM router.
- **Plugin consolidation:** `plugins/colony-memory/` is the SINGLE canonical Hermes memory
  provider (merged: reply thread-window, `colony_resolve_commitment`, the battle-tested
  sync architecture, and the `pre_llm_call` contact/time hook). `plugins/hermes-memory/`
  and `plugins/hermes-plugin/memory_provider/` are deleted; `install.sh` and the wizard
  both deploy from it to `~/.hermes/plugins/colony-memory/`.
- **Docs refresh + genericity:** README, CONTRIBUTING, harness guide, and `.env.example`
  rewritten to match the codebase; the Hermes install URL corrected everywhere to
  `https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent`; remaining deployment-identity strings
  scrubbed from fixtures and docs.

## v0.21.33 — InitiativeExecutorService: autonomous initiative processing

A generic initiative executor closes the autonomy circuit without an external agent: it
uses Colony's own ReasoningLoop (LLM + tools) to claim pending initiatives, reason about
them, execute actions, and report results back to the store.

- **Opt-in** via `COLONY_EXECUTOR_ENABLED=true`, with configurable LLM tier, initiative
  types, cycle interval, and concurrency. Stats via `/v1/host/health` notes and
  `/v1/host/executor/status`.
- **CI:** auth-coverage test walks the nested route tree and is compatible with
  FastAPI 0.138+.

## v0.21.32 — the autonomy circuit runs itself (agent bridge)

Two steps toward zero-setup autonomy delivery (the first shipped untagged as v0.21.31):

- **`colony-agent-bridge` console script:** one long-running daemon replaces the three
  separate cron scripts (initiative-poller, queue-worker, skills-sync) and adds circuit
  health monitoring that catches silent failures — sidecar unreachable, autonomy loop
  stuck, initiatives never executed, jobs stuck in queue. `--once` for cron, `--dry-run`
  for validation; stdlib-only.
- **Built-in AgentBridgeService:** an internal async service that closes the same circuit
  with no platform-specific setup at all (no cron, no LaunchAgent, no systemd). Auto-starts
  at sidecar boot when `COLONY_BRIDGE_WEBHOOK_URL` is set, accessing the initiative store
  and task queue directly. Stats via `/v1/host/health` notes and `/v1/host/bridge/status`.

## v0.21.30 — official Hermes plugin moves into the repo (generic adapter)

The Hermes "colony" plugin now lives in this repo at `plugins/hermes-plugin/` [corrected:
this entry originally said `integrations/hermes/colony/`, which never existed] as the
official, deployment-agnostic adapter, co-located with the API it calls so their contract
can't silently drift.

- **Generic plugin** (tools, ColonyClient, event subscriber, slash commands, hooks, autonomy
  bridge). All owner/persona specifics are removed: the autonomy bridge ships a generic
  default prompt and reads `plugins.colony.autonomy_prompt` (inline or file path) +
  `plugins.colony.autonomy_deliver` from Hermes config, so a deployment injects its persona
  and channel without touching the core.
- **Contract test** (`tests/test_hermes_plugin_contract.py`): auto-discovers every
  `/v1/host/...` path the plugin references and asserts each is a registered route across the
  host/queue/observations routers. This is the guard that would have caught the
  `/tasks` → `/initiatives` drift that failed silently in production.


## v0.21.29 — introduction proposals clear the confidence gate

Final fix for Slice 2, found in live verification: an introduction was generated but never
surfaced because `generate()` applies the `min_priority` confidence filter (autonomy default
**0.7**) BEFORE the cap, and the intro's flat priority 0.5 was filtered out first — so the v0.21.28
cap headroom never got a chance to run.

- **Introduction priority 0.5 → 0.7** so it clears the default confidence gate. An intro is
  high-CONFIDENCE (a real shared-work signal plus both parties above the trust floor), just
  low-urgency; the cap's social headroom (v0.21.28) handles volume once it is past the filter.

Verified end-to-end on a live deployment: two same-org contacts above the trust floor produced
an owner-facing `INTRODUCTION` proposal ("Introduce A and B (both at <org>)").

## v0.21.28 — introduction proposals survive a saturated cap

Completes Slice 2: introduction proposals are low-priority by design, so on a busy loop that
saturates the per-cycle initiative cap they were generated but always cut. Verified live — the
loop reported "20 new proposals" every cycle and the intro never surfaced.

- **Bounded social headroom:** the initiative cap now tops up to `_INTRO_HEADROOM`
  (`COLONY_INTRO_HEADROOM`, default 2) introduction proposals from the cut tail, so an
  operational backlog can't permanently starve them. Owed deliverables remain unbounded.
- **Refactor:** the cap + starvation guards moved into a testable `_apply_cap()` helper
  (behaviour unchanged for the deliverable exemption).

## v0.21.27 — organic introduction proposals (social-graph autonomy, Slice 2)

The agent can now proactively notice that two people it knows should probably meet, and propose
the introduction for the owner to approve. PROPOSE-ONLY and owner-gated by construction — an
INTRODUCTION is its own initiative type, not an `agent_action`, so the loop surfaces it and never
auto-executes it.

- **`INTRODUCTION` initiative type** + `_generate_introduction_initiatives()`: consumes
  introduction candidates and proposes "introduce A and B" with `action_hint=propose_introduction`.
  Owner exclusion fails closed (never introduce the owner). One-shot `dedup_key` (`intro:<lo>:<hi>`,
  ids sorted) so a pair is proposed once; the store's terminal-dedup stops re-proposing after the
  owner acts. Marked DURABLE in context-freshness.
- **`SQLiteContactStore.introduction_candidates()`**: finds pairs sharing an organization (a
  "related work" signal) where BOTH sit at/above a trust floor; excludes the owner and soft-deleted
  contacts. Deployment-agnostic (pure contacts SQL, no graph dependency).
- **Autonomy feed:** `_feed_introduction_candidates()` runs in the initiative phase, gated by
  `COLONY_INTROS_ENABLED` (default true) with `COLONY_INTRO_TRUST_FLOOR` (default `regular`). Owner
  exclusion fails closed.

## v0.21.26 — introduction capture (social-graph autonomy, Slice 1)

The generic, deployment-agnostic foundation for organic relationship-building: the agent can
record a person it just met or learned of as a durable contact WITH provenance, but WITHOUT any
interaction standing. Slice 1 of the social-graph-autonomy arc (Feature B); the world-model edge
+ introduction initiative come in Slice 2.

- **Introduction provenance on contacts:** new `introduced_by` (contact_id) + `met_via` (`{channel,
  scope_id, ...}`) fields, auto-migrated onto the contacts table. First-class on the contact so they
  are always available even before a world-model Person node exists.
- **`POST /v1/host/contacts/intro`:** capture an introduction. Creates a PROVISIONAL contact
  (`import_source=agent_intro`, `interaction_allowed` forced false — an intro never grants outreach
  standing) or, when the handle already resolves to a known person, records the provenance on that
  contact instead of duplicating it (first introduction wins; standing untouched). RCS handles are
  stored under the canonical phone gateway.
- **`WM_INTRODUCED_BY` relationship type** added to the world model (consumed in Slice 2).
- **Store:** `create()` accepts `introduced_by`/`met_via`; new `record_introduction()` annotates an
  existing contact. Audited.

## v0.21.25 — health: stop reading conversational idle as "degraded"

The `/health` endpoint flagged `prefetch` stale at 2h and forced the whole system to
`degraded`. But `last_prefetch_at` is touched only by `/context/assemble`, which is driven
by inbound conversation turns — so any normal quiet period (overnight, focus time) tripped it.
That both cried wolf and masked real degradation.

- **Prefetch staleness threshold 2h → 24h** (`COLONY_STALE_PREFETCH_HOURS` default), matching
  the agent-snapshot views. 24h means "the host has not requested context in a full day" — the
  point where idle becomes a genuine integration-down signal. Internal-loop metrics (sync 2h,
  tick 24h, initiative 48h) are unchanged, so a stuck loop is still caught.
- **test:** `test_telemetry_staleness.py` pins the profile — a multi-hour conversational idle
  stays healthy, a >24h prefetch gap flags, and a stuck `sync` is still flagged.

## v0.21.24 — writeback idempotency guardrails

Hardening so the v0.21.23 writeback-idempotency bug class cannot silently recur or be
misdiagnosed again. No behavior change to the happy path; all additions are backward
compatible.

- **Idempotency regression test:** `test_writeback_phase_is_idempotent_across_runs` drives a
  job to COMPLETED through a real queue, runs `_phase_job_writeback()` twice, and asserts the
  job is processed exactly once (memory written once, initiative closed once, `memory_synced`
  persisted). A future regression in tag persistence now fails in CI instead of silently
  re-writing memory and re-fulfilling commitments every cycle in production.
- **Loud failure on a stuck marker:** the writeback now logs a warning if `merge_job_tags`
  cannot persist `memory_synced` (the original bug was invisible because the failed tag write
  was a silent no-op). An infinite re-process loop now announces itself.
- **Honest `/autonomy/cycle`:** the response now includes `mode`, `ran_synchronously`, and a
  `note`. In proactive mode it returns `ran_synchronously: false` (the endpoint only wakes the
  loop; the tick — including job-writeback — runs asynchronously, so the DB is not yet
  updated). Callers and e2e tests must poll. `completed` and `result` are unchanged.

## v0.21.23 — autonomy dispatch + writeback durability

Three fixes that make the autonomy initiative loop actually deliver and converge. The
deliverable backstop (v0.21.21) was generating commitments but the loop silently dropped
every fresh initiative before it could be dispatched, recurring initiatives never re-armed,
and finished jobs were re-processed forever.

- **Dispatch guard fix (Fix 1):** the store assigns its own UUID primary key, so the engine's
  logical id (e.g. `deliver-{cid}`) never equaled the stored id — the old `_phase_execute`
  guard `stored.id != original_id` therefore skipped *every* freshly created initiative,
  blocking all initiative dispatch (observation syncs used a separate path and masked it).
  `store.create_with_outcome` now returns an explicit outcome
  (`created` / `reactivated` / `deduped_active` / `deduped_terminal`); the loop dispatches
  only on `created`/`reactivated`. `store.create` is kept as a back-compat shim.
- **Recurring re-arm + cross-period guard (Fix 2):** recurring initiative types
  (relationship, health, followup, ...) get a time-bucketed `dedup_key`
  (`{base}:{bucket}`) so they re-arm each period, while the new `dedup_base` column holds the
  un-bucketed logical key. The store suppresses a new instance whenever *any* active one
  shares the base, so a still-pending instance is never duplicated when the period rolls over.
  One-shot types (commitment, agent_action, gaps) keep their stable key and stay one-shot.
  Adds the `dedup_base` column (auto-migrated) + index and `get_active_by_dedup_base`.
- **Writeback idempotency fix:** `update_job_status` refuses terminal jobs (to block illegal
  status revivals), but the autonomy writeback tags *completed/failed* jobs with its
  `memory_synced` marker — so the tag never persisted and every finished `agent_action` was
  re-written to memory (and re-fulfilled) on every cycle. New `merge_job_tags` persists
  tag-only updates on terminal jobs without touching status; the writeback uses it.
- **Deliverable cap-exemption:** an owed deliverable (`agent_deliver_message`) is never
  dropped by the per-cycle initiative cap — someone is actively waiting on it.

## v0.21.22 — inline turn introspection

A sidecar-side per-turn introspection that runs the owed-follow-up judgment in-process
against a configured local LLM and records commitments directly — the path that works on
deployments where no host plugin consumes the `cognition.requested` event.

- **Inline introspection** (`cognition/introspection.py`): on `/turns/sync`, when
  `COLONY_INTROSPECT_ENABLED=true`, the sidecar judges the turn with an OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint (`COLONY_INTROSPECT_BASE_URL` / `_MODEL` / `_API_KEY`) and records any durable
  commitment or immediate owed deliverable directly via the commitment store. A focused,
  JSON-only few-shot prompt (so small/no-think local models comply). Disabled by default;
  deployment-agnostic.
- **test:** pin `agent_deliver_message` in the outbound registry-tier audit.

## v0.21.21 — introspection follow-through + agent_action execution

Per-turn cognition can now record an *owed deliverable* — something the person
asked to be sent in this exchange that wasn't done — as a first-class commitment,
and the autonomy loop actually delivers it. Plus two worker bugs that were
silently failing every queued `agent_action`.

- **Deliverable commitments:** the per-turn cognition prompt now recognizes an
  immediate owed deliverable (e.g. "text me the result") alongside durable future
  commitments. It is recorded as a commitment tagged `metadata.kind="deliverable"`
  with `source_type="introspection"`; the autonomy loop turns an undelivered one
  into an `agent_deliver_message` agent_action, and job-writeback marks the
  commitment fulfilled once it is sent. Adds the `agent_deliver_message` action
  (outbound, recipient-gated by the graduated policy). `/turns/sync` now forwards
  the verbatim user+assistant turn to cognition so the deliverable and its content
  can be judged.
- **Worker job-type scoping (fix):** a `WorkerNode` built with a handler dict left
  `job_types` empty, which `WorkerCapabilities.can_accept` treats as "accept all
  types" — so an embedded worker claimed `agent_action` jobs it had no handler for
  and failed every one. It now advertises only the job types it can run.
- **create_job priority (fix):** `JobPriority(body.priority.upper())` raised on
  every call (an int-Enum constructed by name-as-value, even for the default
  "normal"). It is now a by-name lookup that also accepts the numeric value.

## v0.21.20 — remote reranker

Recall now has a working rerank stage: the sidecar can use a reranker served
off-box over an OpenAI/Jina-compatible `/v1/rerank` endpoint, the same way the
embedder is served.

- **Remote reranker:** new `openai_api` path in the reranker init. Set
  `COLONY_RERANKER_PROVIDER=openai_api`, `COLONY_RERANKER_BASE_URL`,
  `COLONY_RERANKER_API_KEY`, and `COLONY_RERANKER_MODEL`; without these env
  vars the local MLX/CUDA/CPU path is unchanged.
- **Qwen3-Reranker correctness:** `COLONY_RERANKER_PROMPT_STYLE=qwen3` wraps
  rerank requests in the model's instruction template. Qwen3-Reranker scores
  from yes/no token logits that are only calibrated under that template —
  vLLM's `/v1/rerank` does not apply it server-side, and raw strings rank
  noise above relevant passages.

## v0.21.19 — release tooling

No functional or packaging changes; the sidecar is identical to v0.21.18. This
release exercises the new release pipeline end to end.

- **CI/release:** GitHub Actions bumped off the deprecated Node 20 runtime
  (`checkout` v6, `setup-python` v6, the docker actions v4/v7) ahead of GitHub's
  forced Node 24 migration.
- **Release automation:** pushing a tag now auto-creates the GitHub Release from
  the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section, after the PyPI and GHCR publishes succeed.

## v0.21.18 — repository cleanup

No functional changes; the shipped package is identical to v0.21.17. This release
refreshes the PyPI project page with the polished README.

- **Docs:** remove implemented and superseded design/spec documents (the root
  `DESIGN-self-initiatives` drafts, `specs/`, `docs/specs/`, and the
  `docs/*-spec.md` files) and the internal trackers (`TODOs.md`, `NIGHTLOG.md`,
  `docs/deferred-items.md`, `docs/open-items-plan.md`, `docs/audits/`).
- **Code comments:** drop dangling spec references — docstrings and `§`-section
  pointers to specs that were never committed — from the `chain/` module.
- **Tests:** remove an orphaned root-level test the runner never collected.
- **README:** Mermaid architecture diagram and copy polish.

## v0.21.17 — correctness + hardening pass

- **Initiatives:** normalize Neo4j datetimes to tz-aware UTC. Naive timestamps
  raised a swallowed `TypeError` that silently dropped every blocked-goal and
  pending-research initiative.
- **Relationship scoring:** the scheduled phase now recomputes the SQLite
  closeness score every consumer reads (previously only the dead Neo4j path ran),
  so a contact's score keeps decaying when no turn arrives.
- **Goal inference:** preserve the inferred deadline and provenance on proposed
  goals instead of dropping them.
- **Commitments:** persist `due_at` as canonical UTC ISO so overdue detection (a
  string comparison) is reliable; mixed naive/offset values had broken it.
- **Security:** the sidecar fails closed when bound to a non-loopback address with
  no `COLONY_API_KEY` instead of serving open with only a warning; adds an auth
  test over the full route table.
- **Briefings:** reuse one shared async bridge pool instead of creating an
  executor per aggregator call.
- **Observability:** surface cognition-cycle step errors (previously discarded)
  and report the real consolidation merged-count.

## v0.21.1 — memory reliability + recall quality

Fixes that make Colony memory production-reliable:
- **Recall quality**: embed retrieval queries with the asymmetric Qwen3 instruction
  prefix (configurable via COLONY_EMBED_QUERY_INSTRUCTION). Without it, vector
  retrieval was near-random (~0.9 cosine distance on everything) and the right
  memory never surfaced; with it, the correct memory ranks first.
- **No silent memory loss**: refuse to store a memory when an embedding was
  expected but unavailable (was creating unsearchable, embeddingless nodes during
  embed outages).
- **Embed resilience**: retry the embedding endpoint with backoff (the embedder
  is often a remote/tunnelled service).
- **Dedup**: memories are deduped by content hash (a recurring prompt had been
  stored 70+ times); empty memories are dropped.


## 0.20.0 (2026-06-10)

Scheduled-worker installation: the agent-side workers become part of
the pip package, the wizard schedules them, and the doctor detects when
the queue worker is missing.

### Added
- **`colony_sidecar.workers` package** (stdlib-only): the queue-worker
  and skills-sync logic moved out of the loose
  `plugins/hermes-plugin/poller/` scripts into
  `colony_sidecar.workers.queue_worker` / `.skills_sync`, shipped as the
  `colony-queue-worker` and `colony-skills-sync` console scripts
  (same env vars and behavior; both support `--dry-run`). The old
  script paths remain as thin back-compat wrappers (import-and-call
  with a repo-relative `sys.path` fallback).
- **Wizard Step 10e "Scheduled agent workers"** (`colony init`,
  idempotent on re-run): asks whether the agent lives on this machine
  and installs crontab entries on macOS/Linux — `*/5 * * * *`
  queue worker + `0 9 * * *` skills sync, sourcing the wizard's `.env`
  (`set -a`), logging to `$COLONY_HOME/logs/cron-<name>.log`. Merges
  with the existing crontab (never duplicates a worker referenced in
  either console-script or `python -m` form); prints the exact lines
  for manual install when declined or crontab is unavailable.
- **`colony doctor` `server-worker-liveness` check**: WARNs when any
  QUEUED `agent_action` job is older than 15 minutes (queue worker
  appears absent — auto-approved jobs would sit QUEUED forever), with
  the cron-install remedy. Uses the existing authed
  `/v1/host/queue/jobs/pending` surface; skips when the sidecar or
  task queue is down. Skill-staleness remedies now point at the
  `colony-skills-sync` console command.

## 0.19.0 (2026-06-10)

Setup catches up with autonomy: the wizard configures the v0.16-v0.18
surface, and `colony doctor` becomes a real configuration diagnostic.

### Added
- **Wizard Step 8 "Autonomy & approvals"** (`colony init`, idempotent on
  re-run): owner contact creation written directly into the contact
  store (+ `COLONY_OWNER_CONTACT_ID`), plain-language strict/graduated
  approval-policy choice, internal-thinking and skill-synthesis toggles,
  home-channel selection. The wizard now ends with a doctor pass
  (Step 12).
- **`colony doctor` rebuilt as a config-aware check engine** (19 checks,
  `--json`, exit codes): every production footgun is detected with an
  exact remedy — LLM baseUrl missing `/v1` (the silent
  "all tiers exhausted" cognition killer), empty apiKey, `:memory:`
  contact store, unresolvable owner, invalid approval-policy values,
  corrupt standing approvals, missing home channel, pending blocked
  approvals, stale/missing agent skill index, launchd
  kickstart-vs-bootstrap stale env. `--fix` applies the safe LLM-config
  repairs; `--clean-orphans` preserved from the old doctor.
- `GET /v1/host/health/llm` — authed, live-fires one tiny SMALL-tier
  completion so router death can never hide again.

### Fixed
- Wizard LLM-config writes normalize `baseUrl` to `/v1` and never emit
  an empty `apiKey` (the source of both footguns).
- Wizard previously collected multimodal settings *after* writing
  `.env`, silently dropping them; config is now re-written after all
  steps.

## 0.18.0 (2026-06-10)

Graduated approvals (the owner only hears about destructive actions and
unauthorized outreach) + the Hermes↔Colony skills bridge.

### Added
- **Graduated approval policy** (`COLONY_APPROVAL_POLICY=graduated`;
  default remains `strict` = v0.17 behavior). Under graduated: read-only
  and reversible-mutating actions auto-execute with an audit trail
  (`auto_approved_by_policy` job tags + `action_auto_approved` events);
  a new DESTRUCTIVE risk tier (merges, deletes, restarts, deploys)
  always requires owner approval; OUTBOUND is reserved for actions that
  reach a *person* and auto-passes only when the recipient resolves to a
  contact with `interaction_allowed` — unknown targets fail closed.
- **Standing approvals** — approve a blocked job with `{"always": true}`
  and that action class is pre-authorized from then on (per-action-class
  approval records, persisted at `$COLONY_STATE_DIR/standing_approvals.json`;
  `GET /v1/host/queue/approvals/standing`, `DELETE .../{action_name}`).
- **Hermes skill export** — approving a captured procedural skill also
  renders a Hermes-format `SKILL.md` into `COLONY_HERMES_SKILLS_DIR`
  (default `~/.hermes/skills/colony`), with provenance frontmatter and a
  no-overwrite guard for non-Colony files. Gate:
  `COLONY_EMIT_HERMES_SKILLS` (default off).
- **Agent skill-index sync** — the OpenClaw plugin scans the Hermes
  skills directory (startup + daily) and reports it into the new
  push-only `skills` observation domain; the self-directed thinking
  situation report now includes the agent's actual capabilities.
- Action specs gained `target_param` (recipient extraction for outbound
  authorization checks).

### Fixed
- Reclassified `coding_comment_on_pr` and `system_send_alert` from
  OUTBOUND to MUTATING — platform writes, not person outreach.
- Test-only Node 18 polyfill for `toSorted`/`toReversed` (10 vitest
  suites were failing at baseline on Node <20).

## 0.17.0 (2026-06-10)

The autonomous engine: Colony now thinks, acts behind an enforceable
approval gate, and learns from what its agent does.

### Added
- **Self-directed thinking (Phase 5b)** — on a slow cadence
  (`COLONY_THINKING_INTERVAL_SECS`, default 1h; gated by
  `COLONY_ENABLE_INTERNAL_THINKING`, default off) the autonomy loop hands
  the LLM a situation report (goals, pending work, commitments, current
  initiatives) and lets it propose novel initiatives. Proposals are
  priority-capped (0.85), deduped across cycles, and can never carry an
  `action_hint` — thought-up work always lands as review/decide
  initiatives, so mutating/outbound ideas still cross the action
  registry and owner approval before any agent touches them.
- **Server-side approval gate** — gated agent actions are now *created*
  in BLOCKED state (no submit-then-transition race); claims can never
  hand out blocked jobs; `GET /v1/host/queue/jobs/blocked`,
  `POST /v1/host/queue/jobs/{id}/approve`, `POST .../reject` (409 on
  non-blocked); initiative responses sync to the linked job; stale
  approvals auto-fail after `COLONY_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_HOURS` (72).
- **Job-completion memory writeback (Phase 6c)** — completed/failed
  agent jobs become episodic memories (`source_uri colony://jobs/{id}`),
  advance their goals (`goals.on_job_completed` existed since v0.13 but
  was never called), close their linked initiatives, and broadcast
  events. Idempotent via the `memory_synced` job tag.
- **Skill capture** (`COLONY_ENABLE_SKILL_SYNTHESIS`, default off) —
  successful novel agent work flows through the existing-but-dormant
  learning pipeline (novelty gate → pattern extraction → DRAFT skill
  package). Captured skills are DRAFT with deny-by-default capabilities
  and surface a review initiative; nothing synthesized executes without
  owner approval.
- `POST /v1/host/contacts` (+ handles) so deployments can bootstrap the
  owner contact the IdentityResolver requires.

### Fixed
- **Contact store now persists** — the server built it with the default
  `sqlite_path=":memory:"`, wiping all contacts (including the owner)
  on every restart. Now resolves `COLONY_CONTACTS_DB` or
  `$COLONY_STATE_DIR/colony-contacts.db`.
- **contact_handles gateway constraint** — whatsapp/discord/slack were
  deliverable channels but unstorable handles.
- Capability-gap / knowledge-acquisition / behavioral-correction
  generators hardened against the real graph schema (schema-adaptive
  queries, env thresholds, defensive failure paths).
- CI/Release workflows on node 22 (engines requires >=22.16); npm
  publish non-blocking until the @aevonix npm org exists.
- 35 of 36 dependabot alerts resolved (npm audit + openclaw bump; the
  remaining moderate hono pin sits inside openclaw's published
  npm-shrinkwrap and is unfixable downstream).

## 0.16.0 (2026-06-10)

Initiative pipeline fixes + autonomous work engine foundations.

### Fixed
- **Remote embedding via `COLONY_EMBED_PROVIDER=openai_api` actually works** — the text-only startup path never called `provider.configure()`, leaving base_url/api_key empty; and the request payload always sent `dimensions`, which vllm rejects (HTTP 400) for non-matryoshka models such as Qwen3-Embedding-8B. Running in production against a remote CUDA endpoint since 2026-06-10 (parity cosine >0.9998 vs the native-MLX path).
- **Auth middleware accepts `X-API-Key`** — the initiative poller and the new queue worker authenticate with `X-API-Key` (and advertise that header to agents in job payloads), but the middleware only honored `Authorization: Bearer`, so on keyed deployments every poller/worker call returned 401. Either header is now accepted with the same constant-time comparison.
- **Initiative API: title is the action, not the reason** — serializer used `rationale` ("No contact for 14 days") as the title instead of `description` ("Check in with Jordan Example"). Rationale now travels inside the context dict.
- **Initiative API: `entity_id` exposed** — the subject of an initiative (person, PR, commitment) is now returned; `target_agent_id` is populated from assignment instead of hardcoded `null`. Subject and executor stay distinct fields.
- **Initiative API: context no longer empty** — the autonomy loop's per-initiative context snapshot is persisted to a new `context` column (idempotent migration; pre-migration rows return `{}`) and returned over the REST API, stamped with `context_captured_at`.
- **Owner self-initiative filter** — replaced the broken `COLONY_HOST_CONTACT_ID`/`"owner"`-default equality check with an `IdentityResolver` backed by the contact store (CID ↔ Neo4j Person UUID ↔ display name ↔ handles). `COLONY_OWNER_CONTACT_ID` is canonical (legacy var still honored with a deprecation warning). Missing/unresolvable owner now fails **closed** (CRITICAL log, relationship generation disabled) instead of open. Filter is scoped to relationship generators only — the owner remains a valid subject for commitment/calendar/agent-action work.
- **`InitiativeResponse.status`** accepted `"in_progress"` but not `"assigned"`, breaking serialization of assigned initiatives.
- **`POST /initiatives`** dropped the request `context`, lacked `entity_id`, and stored the 0–100 priority unscaled (clamping everything to 100).

### Added
- **IdentityResolver** (`identity/resolver.py`) — `resolve(any_id) → set[str]` across all identifier formats; ambiguous display names resolve to nothing rather than merging people.
- **Action registry** (`initiatives/action_registry.py`) — `action_hint` is a named, allow-listed capability with risk tiers (`read_only` auto-executes; `mutating`/`outbound` block on human-owner approval). Unregistered hints are never queued. Covers task/coding/project/system/calendar/commitment/research/agent actions.
- **Context durability & freshness** (`initiatives/context_freshness.py`) — every initiative type declares durable vs volatile context with per-type freshness TTLs; `context_durability` returned by the API.
- **Per-entity context refresh** — `POST /v1/host/initiatives/{id}/context/refresh` routes to `engine.rebuild_context()` (relationship and commitment rebuilders shipped; volatile types without a rebuilder return 501 instead of stale data).
- **New initiative types** — `COMMITMENT`, `CALENDAR`, `RESEARCH`, `TASK`, `PROJECT`, `SYSTEM` join the existing 12.
- **COMMITMENT generator** — commitments surface as first-class durable initiatives (`dedup_key=commitment:{id}`, overdue escalation) instead of anonymous scheduling opportunities.
- **Agent-as-sensor loop** — Colony never calls external APIs; the agent observes through its own Hermes connections and reports back:
  - Observation store (`observations/`) + ingestion API (`POST/GET /v1/host/observations`) across six domains (coding, task, calendar, research, project, system)
  - Autonomy loop posts read-only `agent_sync_<domain>` jobs to the task queue when a domain's observations go stale (`COLONY_SYNC_DOMAINS` scopes it)
  - Six observation-backed generators: failing-CI/review-requested PRs, stale tasks, events starting within 24h, unchecked research, milestones due with open work, unhealthy services
  - Volatile auto-close: `POST /initiatives/{id}/context/refresh` cancels initiatives whose condition has cleared (CI green, service recovered) with `stale_reason="condition_cleared"`
  - Hermes plugin: `colony-queue-worker.py` claims agent jobs and hands them to the agent via the new `colony-jobs` webhook route with curl-able lifecycle URLs
- **Agent-brain framing sweep** — `notify_user` defaults replaced with `review_and_decide` (regression-tested); relationship hint changed to `evaluate_relationship`; webhook prompts rewritten around five agent decision verbs (execute/snooze/dismiss/communicate/request-approval).

## 0.15.1 (2026-05-23)

Live Neo4j integration validation — 2 critical fixes found against real data.

### Fixed
- **`duration.between(...).days` → `duration.inDays(...).days`** — Neo4j normalizes durations into months + days. `duration.between(...).days` returns the *component* days (e.g. 29 for a 60-day span), not total days. This caused:
  - `archive_memories()` to never archive memories older than ~1 month
  - `decay_memories()` to under-decay memories older than ~1 month
- **Null-property safety in `_update_effective_confidence_batch()`** — `row.get("base_confidence", 1.0)` returns `None` when the key exists but the property is `null` (pre-v0.15.0 legacy memories). Switched to `or` fallback to prevent `TypeError` on the first decay pass against any graph with old data.

## 0.15.0 (2026-05-23)

Memory governance & epistemic hygiene — source anchoring, confidence computation, decay, pruning, reconciliation, and archival.

### Added
- **Epistemic state machine** — 8 states (`inferred`, `observed`, `corroborated`, `verified`, `stale`, `superseded`, `deprecated`, `archived`) with `transition_epistemic_state()` API
- **Source anchoring** — every memory records `source_type`, `source_uri`, `source_version`, `content_hash`
  - `MemorySourceType` enum: `conversation`, `file`, `tool_output`, `user_assertion`, `inference`
  - `SOURCE_RELIABILITY` weighting: user_assertion (1.0) > file (0.9) > tool_output (0.85) > conversation (0.7) > inference (0.5)
  - `MAX_IMPORTANCE` clamping per source type to prevent over-inflation
  - `protected` flag auto-set for `user_assertion` memories (immune to pruning)
- **Effective confidence computation** — multi-signal formula:
  - Base: `base_confidence × source_reliability`
  - Corroboration boost / contradiction penalty
  - Recall reinforcement (diminishing returns, cap 1.3×)
  - Recency discount (~10%/year exponential decay)
  - Verification boost (1.2× if verified within 7 days)
  - State floors/penalties: `verified` ≥ 0.9, `stale`/≠superseded × 0.3, `deprecated` × 0.1
- **Ebbinghaus decay** — `decay_memories()` applies forgetting curve:
  - Formula: `strength = importance × e^(-λ × days) × (1 + recalls × 0.2)`
  - Identity memories never decay; procedural at half rate; protected skipped
- **Pruning** — `prune_weak_memories()` deletes memories with `strength < 0.05`
  - Skips protected, `corroborated`, `verified`, and fully terminal states
- **File reconciliation** — `FileReconciler` validates file-sourced memories against ground truth:
  - Detects deleted files → marks `STALE`
  - Hash-match unchanged files → marks `VERIFIED`
  - Hash-mismatch → creates superseded version with preserved entities
  - `dry_run` mode for safe preview
- **Archival** — `archive_memories()` moves terminal-state memories to `:ArchivedMemory` after 30 days:
  - Copies `MENTIONS`, `ABOUT`, `SUPERSEDES`, `DERIVED_FROM` relationships
  - Removes from LanceDB vector store
- **Batch confidence refresh** — `_update_effective_confidence_batch()` recalculates all memories in 1000-item batches
- **19 unit tests** — `tests/test_memory_governance.py` covering confidence signals, write governance, epistemic states, source anchoring, reconciler structure

### Fixed (5-pass audit)
- `record_turn()` `NameError`: undefined `meta` → `metadata`; now passes `contact_id` as `person_id`
- `store_memory()` missing Cypher params: `source_type`, `source_uri`, `source_version`, `content_hash`
- `compute_effective_confidence()` Neo4j `DateTime` compatibility via `.to_native()`
- `decay_memories()` null `accessed_at` safety with `coalesce(m.accessed_at, m.created_at, datetime())`
- `prune_weak_memories()` / `verify_memory()` docstring accuracy
- `FileAnchor` lazy creation during `store_memory()` for file sources
- Reconciler query efficiency via `FileAnchor` index
- `source_type` case normalization preventing `MAX_IMPORTANCE` lookup misses

## 0.14.1 (2026-05-23)

Audit-driven hardening — graph schema, silent-failure logging, stale-comment cleanup.

### Fixed
- **Graph schema migrations now run on startup** — `run_migrations()` applied after `ColonyGraph` init so constraints/indexes exist before any queries execute
- **Timezone crash in goal completion** — `goals/store.py` `_parse_dt()` normalizes all datetimes to UTC, preventing `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`
- **WebSearchTool startup failure** — removed invalid `graph_client=` kwarg from constructor call in `reasoning/executor.py`
- **SkillRegistry startup failure** — corrected constructor call (removed legacy `db_path=` and `.open()`)
- **Stale `owner_check_in` schedule spam** — scheduler now auto-deletes schedules with no registered callback instead of warning forever

### Changed
- **Silent failures now logged** — 13 `except Exception: pass` blocks across `autonomy/loop.py`, `server.py`, `goals/store.py`, `patterns/extract.py`, `research/artifact.py`, `performance_index.py`, `signal_collector.py`, and `session_safety.py` now emit `logger.debug`/`logger.warning` with context
- **Clarified non-actionable TODOs** — `cli.py` node keypair comment, `delivery/bridge.py` DIGEST status comment, `vector/setup.py` rebuild prerequisites

## 0.14.0 (2026-05-22)

Session context architecture — cross-session state bridge for agent continuity.

### Added
- **Session Report API** (`/v1/host/session-report`):
  - `POST /session-report` — store session summary from agent (start, end, message counts, sentiment, context notes, token usage)
  - `SessionReportStore` — in-memory FIFO (default 20 reports/contact), timezone-aware `get_recent(hours)` filtering
- **Context Digest API** (`/v1/host/context-digest`):
  - `GET /context-digest` — unified state snapshot combining pending initiatives, system health, and recent session history
  - `AgentSnapshotSystemState` schema — autonomy mode, running status, last tick age, stale flags
  - `ContextDigestSessionReport` schema — lightweight session summaries for agent context window
- **`proactive_delivery_enabled` config flag** — gates all `push_initiative()` calls; defaults to `False` for backward compatibility
  - Env var: `COLONY_PROACTIVE_DELIVERY_ENABLED`
- **`last_agent_outreach_at` telemetry field** — renamed from the agent-specific name for generic agent support

### Changed
- **De-personalized codebase** — all owner references changed to generic "owner"; agent references changed to generic "agent"
- **DRY initiative mapping** — extracted `_map_initiative_to_schema()` module-level helper shared by agent-snapshot and context-digest endpoints

### Fixed
- Timezone safety in session report ingestion — `_parse_iso()` helper forces UTC on naive ISO strings
- `SessionReportStore.get_recent()` defensive tzinfo fallback before cutoff comparison
- Query parameter bounds on context-digest: `hours` (1–168), `initiative_limit` (1–100)

## 0.13.0 (2026-05-21)

Agent heartbeat and snapshot endpoints. Colony exposes state; the agent decides when to communicate.

### Added
- **Agent Snapshot API** (`/v1/host/agent-snapshot`):
  - `GET /agent-snapshot` — comprehensive Colony state snapshot for agent evaluation
    - Telemetry with silence hours and stale flags
    - Pending initiatives (top 20), recently completed (top 10), failed (top 10)
    - Autonomy mode, running status, last tick age
    - Computed flags: `high_priority_pending`, `failed_initiatives`, `long_initiative_silence`, `stale_autonomy_loop`
  - `POST /agent-snapshot/record-outreach` — record agent proactive outreach timestamp
- **TelemetryStore** — agent-outreach timestamp field with `to_dict()` serialization
- **Pydantic schemas** — `AgentSnapshotInitiative`, `AgentSnapshotResponse`, `RecordOutreachRequest`, `RecordOutreachResponse`
- **Tests** — `tests/test_agent_snapshot.py` with 6 unit tests (empty state, initiatives, stale tick, silence flags, outreach recording, round-trip)

### Changed
- Replaces `OwnerCheckInTask` (removed in v0.12.1) with a state-exposure model
- Colony never messages the owner directly; the agent evaluates the snapshot and decides on outreach

### Fixed
- `silence_hours` null handling in flag computation (`None > 4` TypeError on fresh telemetry)
- `record_outreach` returns actual touched timestamp instead of stale `now.isoformat()`

## 0.12.0 (2026-05-21)

Agent work queue v0.13.0 — distributed job scheduling for autonomous agent execution.

### Added
- **Task Queue API** (`/v1/host/queue`) — 14 endpoints for job lifecycle:
  - Worker registration, heartbeat, deregistration
  - Job post, claim, start, complete, fail, release, heartbeat
  - Pending/completed listing, queue stats, digest generation
- **SQLite-backed persistent queue** with WAL mode, atomic claims, retry logic, job audit trail
- **the agent cron worker** (`scripts/agent_worker.py`) — claims and executes `AGENT_ACTION` jobs every 5 min
  - Safety: skips destructive actions when owner is in active session
  - Handles `agent_check_repo_status`, `agent_investigate_subsystem`, `agent_cleanup_orphans`
  - Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM/SIGINT deregistration
- **Digest script** (`scripts/digest.py`) — generates Colony Digest initiative from completed/failed jobs
- **Loop integration** — `_post_agent_action_to_queue()` routes `AGENT_ACTION` initiatives to task queue instead of delivery bridge
  - Destructive actions posted as `BLOCKED` with approval fallback to delivery bridge
  - Non-destructive actions posted as `QUEUED` for immediate worker claiming
- **Initiative engine** — `_generate_agent_action_initiatives()` with 4h cooldown and dedup keys
- **Provider schema** — `colony_claim_task` tool exposed to LLM with `worker_id` and `capabilities` params
- **`job_id` field** on Initiative model + store updatable column for task-queue linkage

### Fixed
- **11 runtime bugs** from spec review:
  - Digest payload used invalid `initiative_type` and float priority
  - Worker registration sent dict for capabilities instead of `List[str]`
  - Worker claim used `"worker_id"` key instead of `"node_id"`
  - Worker crashed on empty queue (null JSON response)
  - `worker_heartbeat` called non-existent `queue.worker_heartbeat()`
  - `queue_stats` called non-existent `queue.stats()`
  - `get_digest_jobs` referenced non-existent `completed_at` SQL column
  - Missing `/start` and `/release` endpoints
  - `colony_claim_task` tool schema had empty properties
  - Skipped jobs stayed `CLAIMED` instead of returning to `QUEUED`
  - `repo_status` initiative generated every tick (no cooldown)

## 0.11.1 (2026-05-17)

Self-initiative execution fix and new initiative types.

### Fixed
- **Critical (4 bugs shipped in v0.11.0):**
  - `execute_initiative()` skill name mapping was a no-op (`.replace("_", "_")`) — now uses proper `_SKILL_NAME_MAP`
  - `execute_initiative()` never passed `entity_type` to `InitiativeExecutionContext` — now extracted from `trigger_data`
  - `AutonomyLoop._phase_execute()` bypassed execution entirely — now auto-executes self-initiatives via `engine.execute_initiative()` before pushing to delivery; auto-fixed initiatives skip delivery
  - `data_quality` and `operational_hygiene` skills called non-existent `.publish()` on EventBus — rewritten to use `.emit()`
- **Dependency injection** — `ToolExecutor` now accepts `graph_client` via constructor, eliminating circular imports between `reasoning/` and `api/routers/`

### Added
- **New graph schema types**: `Concept` and `Preference` nodes with full fields
- **Extended schema**: `Capability` gets `status`, `failure_count`, `last_failure_at`; `Pattern` gets `pattern_type`, `trigger`, `action`, `recurrence_count`, `last_triggered_at`, `is_active`
- **New context loaders**: `_load_capability_gaps()`, `_load_knowledge_gaps()`, `_load_behavioral_patterns()` — wired into `InitiativeEngine._load_graph_context()`
- **New initiative generators**: `_generate_capability_gap_initiatives()`, `_generate_knowledge_acquisition_initiatives()`, `_generate_behavioral_correction_initiatives()`
- **New executor skills**: `CapabilityGapSkill`, `KnowledgeAcquisitionSkill` (proposal-only), `BehavioralCorrectionSkill` (proposal-only, stores preferences to graph)
- **`trigger_data` field** added to `Initiative` dataclass so context flows end-to-end from generator → execution
- **`_build_initiative_context()`** extended for `capability_gap`, `knowledge_acquisition`, `behavioral_correction` types

## 0.8.3 (2026-05-15)

Silence-triggered owner check-in and telemetry fix.

### Added
- **Owner Check-In scheduler task** — detects when the autonomy loop has not generated an initiative for a configurable period (default: 1 hour), then emits a `proactive_message` initiative asking the owner if anything is needed
  - `OwnerCheckInTask` with file-backed persistence (`~/.colony/data/autonomy_checkin.json`) so state survives restarts
  - Owner resolution: config override (`COLONY_OWNER_CONTACT_ID`) → identity manager → highest-scored non-stranger contact
  - Safety guards: quiet hours (23:00–07:00), cooldown (default 4h), disabled if telemetry missing
  - Configurable via `COLONY_OWNER_CHECK_IN_ENABLED`, `COLONY_OWNER_CHECK_IN_SILENT_HOURS`, `COLONY_OWNER_CHECK_IN_COOLDOWN_HOURS`
  - Runs as a scheduler task independent of the autonomy loop tick interval

### Fixed
- **`AutonomyLoop._phase_execute()`** now touches `TelemetryStore.last_initiative_at` when initiatives are successfully pushed, fixing `silence_hours("initiative")` which previously reported infinite silence even during active loop operation

## 0.7.24 (2026-05-15)

Anti-spam initiative delivery and autonomy pipeline spec.

### Fixed
- **Initiative dedup reactivation** — only FAILED initiatives are reactivated on duplicate `dedup_key`. Completed and cancelled initiatives stay terminal, eliminating infinite-loop follow-up spam.

### Added
- **`plugins/hermes-plugin/examples/colony-initiative-poller.py`** — production poller with `dedup_key` tracking, `delivery_context` injection, and env-var configuration.
- **`plugins/hermes-plugin/examples/hook-handler.py`** — example Hermes hook handler with nested payload support.


# Changelog

## 0.7.22 (2026-05-14)

Initiative dedup fix and Hermes turns/sync telemetry.

### Fixed
- **InitiativeStore.create()** now reactivates failed/completed/cancelled initiatives when a duplicate `dedup_key` is submitted, instead of crashing on the SQLite UNIQUE constraint.
- **Hermes plugin websockets 15 compat** — `extra_headers` → `additional_headers`.
- **Autonomy follow-up generator** now handles `priority=None` gracefully.

### Added
- **ColonyClient.sync_turn()** — POSTs session summaries to `/v1/host/turns/sync`.
- **`agent:start` hook** in the Hermes plugin captures `session_id` for cross-turn state.
- **`on_session_end` hook** extracts last user/assistant messages and syncs them to Colony automatically.
- Zero Hermes core patches required — all telemetry is plugin-side.

## 0.7.21 (2026-05-12)

Bug-fix release: initiative delivery via WebSocket and plugin apiKey compatibility.

### Fixed
- **Autonomy loop** now broadcasts `initiative` events via WebSocket in addition to HTTP push, ensuring Hermes subscribers receive them in real time.
- **ProactiveDeliveryBridge** falls back to WebSocket broadcast when the gateway's `/internal/initiative` endpoint is unreachable or returns an error.
- **OpenClaw plugin** auth check now accepts both `apiKey` (manifest) and `api_key` (normalized) for compatibility across OpenClaw versions.


## 0.7.20 (2026-05-11)

Qwen3 reranker token config fallback.

### Fixed
- **NativeMLXRerankerProvider** now falls back to `1_LogitScore/config.json` when token IDs are not found in `config_sentence_transformers.json`
  - Qwen3 rerankers (e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B`, `Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-8B`) store `true_token_id` and `false_token_id` in a separate config file
  - Without this fallback the provider silently used raw max-logit scoring, producing incorrect relevance scores

## 0.7.19 (2026-05-11)

Native MLX embedding and reranker providers for Apple Silicon.

### Added
- **NativeMLXEmbeddingProvider** — true Apple Silicon MLX support via `mlx-embeddings`
  - Loads models directly into MLX arrays, bypassing PyTorch MPS overhead
  - Supports original HuggingFace models (on-the-fly conversion) and pre-converted `mlx-community` checkpoints
  - Recommended models: `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` (4096 dims), `BAAI/bge-m3` (1024 dims)
- **NativeMLXRerankerProvider** — native MLX CrossEncoder via `mlx-lm`
  - Extracts true/false token logits for relevance scoring
  - Supports `Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-8B` and `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`
- **Hardware tier matrix** — new `native-mlx-high` (64GB+) and `native-mlx-balanced` (32GB+) tiers
- **Auto-detection** — server and wizard now prefer `native_mlx` when `mlx-embeddings` is installed
- **Setup wizard** — supports `native_mlx` provider selection and model pre-download via MLX loaders

### Changed
- Legacy `MLXEmbeddingProvider` and `MLXRerankerProvider` docstrings clarified: they use PyTorch MPS, not true MLX

## 0.7.18 (2026-05-11)

Hermes integration suite, autonomy bridge, and initiative engine hardening.

### Added
- **Colony-Hermes integration suite** — full plugin for Hermes agent context injection
  - Graph memory MCP server with Neo4j-backed entity/relationship queries
  - Contact reminders via Hermes todo system with neglected-contact detection
  - Context assembly endpoint for agent prompt enrichment
  - Setup wizard (`colony setup --hermes`) for one-command installation
- **Colony autonomy bridge** — Hermes-native initiative tools
  - `initiatives_list` tool for querying pending initiatives
  - `initiative_acknowledge` / `initiative_complete` / `initiative_snooze` lifecycle tools
  - `autonomy_cycle` tool for triggering reactive autonomy ticks
- **Initiative engine hardening**
  - Name deduplication for Person nodes (first + last → canonical full name)
  - Junk contact filtering — skips nodes missing both name and email
  - Graph cleanup — removes stale `:HAS_CONTACT` relationships for non-Person nodes
  - `entity_id` and `dedup_key` fields on health/scheduling initiatives

### Fixed
- **`/autonomy/cycle` reactive mode** — now runs `_tick()` directly instead of scheduling a background task (#23)
- **Schema-adaptive graph queries** — handles `lastCommunication` vs `last_interaction` property variants gracefully

## 0.7.17 (2026-05-10)

MLX reranker fix and new `/memory/rerank` endpoint.

### Added
- **POST /v1/host/memory/rerank** — rerank documents by relevance to a query
  - Returns ranked results with `index`, `score`, `text`
  - Supports up to 256 documents per request
  - Returns 501 if reranker not initialized

### Fixed
- **MLX reranker** — same PyTorch MPS deadlock fix as embeddings (Issue #17)
  - `MLXRerankerProvider.warmup()` now runs synchronously in main thread
- **Reranker initialization** — `make_reranker_provider(spec=None)` returned None
  - Now directly instantiates the correct provider class based on `hw.gpu_type`
- **Reranker warmup** — was never called during lifespan startup, now explicitly awaited
- **Health endpoint** — now exposes `rerank` capability when reranker is wired

## 0.7.16 (2026-05-10)

MLX embedding provider fix and harrier model deprecation.

### Fixed
- **Critical**: MLX embedding provider no longer hangs on Apple Silicon during startup (#17)
  - Root cause: PyTorch MPS backend deadlocked when model initialization ran in `asyncio.run_in_executor()` during FastAPI lifespan startup
  - Fix: `MLXEmbeddingProvider.warmup()` now loads models synchronously in the main thread
  - Startup is not serving requests yet, so brief blocking is acceptable

### Changed
- **Deprecated**: Removed non-functional `microsoft/harrier-oss-v1-27b` model from tiers 5 and 6
  - Replaced with validated `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` (8B params, 4096 dims)
  - Affects 128GB+ RAM systems (Mac Studio Ultra, DGX Spark, servers)
- Setup wizard now warns Apple Silicon users about MLX provider and directs them to CPU provider for stability

## 0.7.14 (2026-05-07)

Initiative engine graph context loading and comprehensive bug fixes.

### Added
- `InitiativeEngine._load_graph_context()` — automatic graph + mind model queries before generation
- Graph loaders: `_load_blocked_goals()`, `_load_neglected_contacts()`, `_load_health_trends()`, `_load_scheduling_opportunities()`, `_load_pending_signals()`, `_load_pending_research_tasks()`
- `InitiativeConfig` dataclass with env var loading (`COLONY_INITIATIVE_*`)
- 10-second graph context cache to avoid redundant queries within same tick
- `clear_context()` resets `_last_graph_load` (Bug 37)
- Priority blending: graph priority (40%) + time-based priority (60%) for follow-ups (Bug 20)
- `entity_id` and `dedup_key` for health/scheduling initiatives (Bugs 44, 45)
- `max_initiatives` parameter to limit output (default 20, Bug 43)
- In-memory initiative list with 1000-item cap (Bug 36)
- 38 comprehensive unit tests for initiative generation
- Environment variables: `COLONY_INITIATIVE_CONTACT_NEGLECT_DAYS`, `COLONY_INITIATIVE_GOAL_BLOCK_DAYS`, `COLONY_INITIATIVE_HEALTH_THRESHOLD`, `COLONY_INITIATIVE_GAP_THRESHOLD`, `COLONY_INITIATIVE_RESEARCH_AGE_DAYS`, `COLONY_INITIATIVE_SIGNAL_THRESHOLD`

### Fixed
- **Critical**: `mark_initiative_generated()` now called for ALL initiatives inside persistence loop (Bug 11)
- **Critical**: Research tasks use actual age from `created_at`, not threshold days (Bug 12)
- **Critical**: `complete()` uses `entity_id` (goal ID) not initiative ID for goal store (Bug 47)
- **Critical**: Neo4j `DateTime` objects handled via `_parse_neo4j_datetime()` (Bugs 50, 51)
- **Critical**: `created_at` uses timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` (Bug 38)
- Negative days prevented with `max(0, ...)` (Bug 13)
- NULL `last_interaction` gets 2× threshold days (Bug 14)
- `acknowledge()` removes from in-memory list (Bug 22)
- Generators run in parallel with `asyncio.gather()` (Bug 33)
- Signal loading separated from scheduling check (Bug 40)
- `get_active()` only falls back on exception, not empty result (Bug 54)
- Store validates priority range [0, 1] (Bug 26)
- `SubsystemRegistry.anomalies` uses shared event bus (Bug 41)
- Parameter validation in `generate()` (Bugs 57, 58)
- Env var parsing with fallback on invalid values (Bug 59)

### Changed
- Exception handling: specific types for connection vs validation vs unexpected errors
- `clear_context(context_type)` preserves `_last_graph_load` (only full clear resets)

## 0.7.10 (2026-04-27)

Initiative deduplication and LLM feedback loop.

### Added
- `last_initiative_at`, `snoozed_until`, `snooze_count`, `dismissal_reason` fields on Goal model
- `GoalStore.complete_task()`, `snooze_task()`, `dismiss_task()`, `get_active_tasks()`, `mark_initiative_generated()`
- Snooze fatigue: auto-dismiss after 3 snoozes
- Initiative engine dedup via GoalStore cooldown (no in-memory state, persists across restarts)
- MCP tools: `colony_task_complete`, `colony_task_snooze`, `colony_task_dismiss`, `colony_initiative_feedback`
- API endpoints: `/tasks/{id}/complete`, `/tasks/{id}/snooze`, `/tasks/{id}/dismiss`, `/initiatives/{id}/respond`
- Native tool definitions for task management in `tools/definitions.py`
- `InitiativeConfig` dataclass with configurable cooldowns
- `entity_type` field in initiative payload
- Action hints in `formatInitiativeText()` for LLM task management
- Environment variables: `COLONY_INITIATIVE_COOLDOWN_TASKS` (default 12h), `COLONY_INITIATIVE_COOLDOWN_CONTACTS` (default 72h)

### Changed
- `_feed_pending_tasks()` now uses `get_active_tasks()` with cooldown awareness
- Initiative generation accepts `cooldown_tasks` and `cooldown_contacts` parameters

## 0.6.21 (2026-04-24)

Fixed port conflict handling in foreground mode.

### Fixed
- Foreground mode (`colony start`) now checks if port is in use before starting
- Exits with error if port occupied, with helpful message
- `--force` flag works in both foreground and daemon modes to kill existing process

## 0.6.20 (2026-04-24)

Harness integration refactor with new CLI flags.

### Changed
- New CLI flags for harness configuration:
  - `--mcp-harnesses` for coding harnesses (claude-code, codex, crush, opencode)
  - `--agent-harness` for agent harnesses (openclaw, hermes)
  - `--no-harness` for standalone mode
- `--host-framework` deprecated but still works for backward compatibility
- Step 3 renamed from "Host framework" to "Harness integration"
- Separate detection and setup for coding harnesses vs agent harnesses
- Standalone mode is now explicit and first-class
- Shows install instructions when OpenClaw is requested but not installed
- Detects Node.js stability (version manager vs system install)

### Added
- `_detect_coding_harnesses()` - detect MCP-capable coding harnesses
- `_detect_agent_harnesses()` - detect agent harnesses (OpenClaw, Hermes)
- `_check_nodejs_stability()` - check if Node.js is system-wide or version manager
- `_setup_mcp_harnesses()` - configure multiple MCP harnesses
- `_setup_agent_harness()` - configure agent harness plugin
- `_show_openclaw_install_instructions()` - platform-specific install guide

### Fixed
- Colony can now run completely standalone with no harness
- Better guidance when harness not installed

## 0.6.19 (2026-04-23)

Fixed crash in wizard plugin setup.

### Fixed
- `non_interactive` parameter now passed to `_configure_openclaw_plugin()`
- Prevents `NameError: name 'non_interactive' is not defined` in non-interactive mode

## 0.6.18 (2026-04-23)

Wizard now uses `openclaw plugins install` for proper plugin registration.

### Changed
- Use `openclaw plugins install @aevonix/colonyai` instead of `npm install -g`
- Check if plugin is already installed before reinstalling
- Prompt to restart gateway after plugin install
- Better error messages for permission/network failures

## 0.6.17 (2026-04-23)

Fixed missing npm dependency.

### Fixed
- Added `@sinclair/typebox` dependency (used by tool-registrar)

## 0.6.16 (2026-04-23)

Added OpenClaw plugin manifest for native plugin installation.

### Added
- `openclaw.plugin.json` manifest for `openclaw plugins install` support
- Declares contextEngine and memory contracts
- Config schema with sidecarUrl, apiKey, hostId settings

## 0.6.15 (2026-04-23)

Improved OpenClaw plugin installation with better error handling.

### Fixed
- Check Node.js version before npm install (requires v22.16+)
- Retry npm install with `sudo` on EACCES permission errors
- Clear guidance when Node version is too old
- Better error messages and next steps

## 0.6.14 (2026-04-23)

Fix: OpenClaw plugin auto-install via npm.

### Fixed
- Wizard now checks if `@aevonix/colonyai` is installed globally
- Auto-installs via `npm install -g @aevonix/colonyai` if missing
- Better error messages when config settings fail

## 0.6.13 (2026-04-23)

Neo4j health check system with auto-recovery.

### New
- `_neo4j_health_check()`: Connect + auth + query verification
- `_neo4j_poll_health()`: Poll with timeout and progress messages
- `COLONY_NEO4J_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` env var (default 30s)

### Fixed
- Neo4j now verified healthy before sidecar accepts requests
- Auto-restart on failed health check for running containers
- Clear error messages with actionable steps on failure
- No more arbitrary `sleep(3)` — waits exactly as long as needed

### Behavior
- Cold start → create container → poll with timeout
- Warm start (stopped) → start → poll with timeout
- Hot start (running) → quick check → restart + poll on failure
- All paths degrade gracefully with clear user guidance

## 0.6.12 (2026-04-23)

Fix: Neo4j auto-start now works in foreground mode.

### Fixed
- Neo4j check moved before detach decision (was only in daemon mode)
- Works for both `colony start` and `colony start -d`

## 0.6.11 (2026-04-23)

Fix: Neo4j auto-start and validate EOF.

### Fixed
- `colony start` now checks and starts Neo4j container if needed
- `colony validate` handles EOF gracefully with helpful message
- Neo4j container persisted across sidecar restarts

## 0.6.10 (2026-04-23)

Fix: `--tier` CLI arg now correctly skips interactive tier selection.

### Fixed
- Tier CLI arg in non-interactive mode now properly skips the tier selection UI
- Tier selection UI is now inside the else block for interactive mode

## 0.6.9 (2026-04-23)

Wizard fixes: Neo4j docker-run and multimodal EOF.

### Fixed
- Neo4j startup now uses `docker run` instead of docker-compose.yml
- Multimodal prompt now uses `_prompt()` for EOF handling
- OpenClaw config set error handling improved

## 0.6.8 (2026-04-23)

Colony init wizard: non-interactive mode and all piped input issues fixed.

### New
- `--non-interactive` mode for headless/automated setup
- `--host-framework` CLI arg (openclaw, hermes, claude-code, codex, crush, standalone)
- `--contact-name` CLI arg
- `--bind` and `--port` CLI args for network configuration
- `--tier` CLI arg for embedding tier selection (0-7)
- `--neo4j-password` CLI arg
- `--skip-model-download` to defer embedding model download
- `--start` flag to start sidecar after init
- `_check_neo4j_auth()` to detect if Neo4j requires authentication
- `_write_config_yaml()` writes `~/.colony/config.yaml` alongside `.env`

### Fixed
- Issue 1: `_prompt()` returns default on EOF instead of crashing
- Issue 2: Tier selection no longer skipped silently when stdin exhausted
- Issue 3: Config YAML now written to `~/.colony/config.yaml`
- Issue 4: Bind address prompt added (interactive) + CLI args
- Issue 5: Neo4j auth detection skips password prompt when auth disabled
- Issue 6: SQLite DBs now stored in `~/.colony/data/` instead of `~/`
- Issue 8: `--skip-model-download` defers model download to first start

### Example
```bash
colony init --non-interactive \\
  --host-framework claude-code \\
  --contact-name owner \\
  --bind 0.0.0.0 \\
  --port 7777 \\
  --tier 6 \\
  --start
```

## 0.6.7 (2026-04-23)

Second code audit: MCP contract, Hermes integration, runtime crash, and security fixes.

### Fixed
- C1: `colony_get_context` now always sends `incoming_message` (was conditionally omitted → 422)
- C2: `TurnSyncRequest` has `user_message`/`assistant_message` fields; sidecar extracts from raw messages
- C3: YAML harness config uses `${COLONY_API_KEY}` template (was baking raw key to disk)
- C4: Synthesized skills get `ColonyRuntime` handle injected (was crashing with missing arg)
- H1: `cancellation_reason` goes into `metadata` dict (was dropped by Pydantic)
- H2: `context` param type changed to `dict` (was str → 422)
- H3: WebSocket `onEvent` wrapped in try/catch (was unguarded → crash propagation)
- H4: Hermes provider logs WARN on 401/403 (was DEBUG, silent degradation)
- H5: Initiative IDs use UUID (was collision-prone `hash() % 100000`)
- H6: `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` everywhere (was mixing naive/aware → TypeError)
- H7: Sandbox `__import__` wrapped with manifest whitelist enforcement
- M1: `arousal` param defaults to 0.5 in `colony_record_affect`
- M2: `expected` param is optional in `colony_record_surprise`
- M6: `refreshSkillTools` debounced with in-flight promise (was racy)

### New
- `sidecar/colony_sidecar/skills/runtime.py` — `ColonyRuntime` class for synthesized skill tool access
- `allowed_imports` field on `SkillPermissions` for manifest-declared module whitelist

## 0.6.2 (2026-04-23)

Code audit fixes from Claude Code security scan.

### Fixed
- H1: Added missing `set_reranker` import to server.py (was silently failing on reranker config)
- H2: Fixed tautological test assertions in test_sidecar.py
- H3: Implemented `probeVectorAvailability` — now checks embed capability instead of hardcoded false
- H4: Removed dead `lastBoundary` variable in pipeline.ts
- H5: Added metrics tracking for invalid blocks (`blocks_rejected`, `blocks_accepted`, `invalid_signatures`)
- H6: Comprehensive block validation: merkle root check, future timestamp rejection, detailed NACK reasons
- H7: 12 Byzantine-fault tests for Raft consensus
- Medium: Error logging for Raft fire-and-forget message sends via `_spawn_send()` helper

### Tests
- 12 new Byzantine-fault tests in `test_consensus_byzantine.py`

## 0.6.1 (2026-04-22)

Colony MCP Server: shared intelligence across agent and coding harnesses.

### New
- MCP server exposing 14 tools, 4+ resources, 3 prompts to Claude Code, Codex, and Crush
- `colony mcp` CLI: run (stdio/HTTP), detect, setup (selective, --dry-run), remove (--dry-run)
- `/mcp` HTTP endpoint on sidecar for streamable HTTP transport
- Harness auto-detection (claude, codex, crush CLIs)
- Selective harness setup: choose which harnesses connect, not all-or-nothing
- Source tracking via COLONY_MCP_SOURCE env var, auto-injected by MCP server
- Provenance field on all MCP writes (separate from sidecar's source enum)
- Contact ID required during setup, set via COLONY_MCP_CONTACT_ID
- Host framework selection in setup wizard (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, Crush, Standalone)
- `mcp[cli]>=1.0` as optional dependency
- 51 MCP unit tests (27 server + 24 config)
- 14/14 MCP tools E2E validated against live sidecar

### Fixed
- World model search endpoint: POST /v1/host/world/entities/query (not GET /search)
- Provenance vs source: MCP provenance writes to `provenance` field, not `source`, to avoid enum conflicts with sidecar schemas

## 0.5.8 (2026-04-22)

New CLI commands for lifecycle management and E2E validation.

- **Added:** `colony start -d` — daemon mode with PID tracking, port conflict detection, auto-kill stale processes
- **Added:** `colony stop` — clean shutdown (SIGTERM → SIGKILL fallback)
- **Added:** `colony status` — health check + E2E validation status
- **Added:** `colony validate` — full pipeline test (seeds data, checks context assembly, optional LLM test)
- **Added:** E2E validation stamp (`.colony-e2e-validated`) — persists across restarts
- **Added:** `colony doctor` check #34: E2E pipeline validated
- **Added:** Validation warnings in `colony status` and `colony start` until E2E is run
- **Added:** Setup wizard prompts for `colony validate` after setup
- **Fixed:** EOFError on `colony start -d` when stdin unavailable

## 0.5.7 (2026-04-22)

Setup wizard bug fixes and gateway restart flow.

- **Fixed:** Neo4j connectivity test in wizard (uses raw driver, not ColonyGraph)
- **Fixed:** Sidecar auto-start in wizard (writes to log file, start_new_session)
- **Fixed:** TIER_TABLE → TIERS import (correct export name)
- **Fixed:** Skip multimodal check when embeddings disabled
- **Added:** Gateway restart verification — waits for restart, checks plugin loaded
- **Added:** Warning that Colony won't receive messages until gateway restart

## 0.5.6 (2026-04-22)

Setup wizard fixes for fresh install experience.

- **Added:** "Skip embeddings" option in tier selection (option 3) — Colony runs without vector search
- **Fixed:** Sidecar auto-start in wizard now uses uvicorn instead of bare module
- **Fixed:** ContactsStore init uses correct `sqlite_path` parameter
- **Fixed:** Neo4j connectivity test uses driver session directly (bypasses query allowlist)
- **Fixed:** `COLONY_EMBED_PROVIDER=skip` no longer crashes EmbeddingPipeline
- **Validated:** Full `pip install colonyai` → `colony init` → sidecar start → health=ok flow

## 0.5.5 (2026-04-22)

Critical packaging and startup fixes.

- **Fixed:** SQL schema files (goals, contacts, task_queue, world_model) missing from pip wheel
- **Fixed:** `COLONY_EMBED_PROVIDER=skip` now gracefully disables embeddings instead of crashing
- **Fixed:** Affect in context assembly reads `current_valence`/`current_arousal` (AffectStore API)
- **Fixed:** `build/` directory accidentally committed to git (removed, added to .gitignore)
- **Added:** `package_data` in pyproject.toml to include SQL/JSON/YAML files in wheel
- **Added:** E2E test scripts for live environment validation (full cycle + turn sync extraction)

## 0.5.4 (2026-04-22)

Fixes for autonomy loop, startup errors, and graph traversal.

### Autonomy
- Autonomy loop now auto-starts on sidecar startup (was manual only)
- AnomalyDetector now receives graph_client + EventBus (was missing required args)
- Fixed import path for RelationshipScorer (nested directory structure)
- MetaLearner returns default CPI when PerformanceIndexComputer not wired (was RuntimeError)

### Goals
- All enum `.value` accesses now use hasattr guards (str vs enum crash)

### Neo4j Backend
- `get_neighbors()` now bidirectional — follows both outgoing and incoming relationships
- Fixes neighborhood traversal and path finding for directed edges

### Health & Setup
- Health endpoint shows autonomy running state + tick count
- Setup wizard adds ownContextEngine + ownMemoryCapability to OpenClaw plugin config
- Setup wizard auto-selects WORLD_MODEL_BACKEND based on Neo4j password
- Setup wizard verifies data flow (creates test commitment, checks context assembly)
- Added asyncio + timezone imports where missing

## 0.5.2 (2026-04-22)

Security and dependency maintenance.

### Security
- Updated openclaw dependency to 2026.4.21 (resolves 9 Dependabot alerts: protobufjs critical, tar high, axios moderate)
- All transitive vulnerabilities now resolved (0 npm audit findings)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `_llm_router` reference in ToM extractor init log (would crash when LLM router is wired)

## 0.5.1 (2026-04-22)

ToM Layer 3: LLM extraction for affect and shared facts.

### ToM LLM Extraction
- TomExtractor: async LLM-backed extraction from conversation turns
- Affect extraction: valence/arousal/trigger from conversation text (neutral readings skipped)
- Fact extraction: knowledge items with source classification
- Per-contact throttle (5 min default, configurable via COLONY_TOM_EXTRACTION_THROTTLE_MINUTES)
- Auto-fires on turn_sync when LLM router is wired
- POST /v1/host/tom/extract for manual extraction
- 21 new unit tests

## 0.5.0 (2026-04-22)

Pattern Extraction + Surprise Engine: pattern detection and anomaly scoring.

### Pattern Extraction
- PatternStore: SQLite-backed CRUD with upsert (frequency increment on duplicate pattern_key)
- Deactivate stale patterns, list with filters (type, min frequency, source, active)
- 4 pattern types: entity_cooccurrence, relation_frequency, temporal_sequence, attribute_cluster
- Extraction logic: entity cooccurrence, relation frequency, attribute clusters
- Extraction workers graceful no-op when world model not wired
- `POST /v1/host/patterns/extract` trigger endpoint

### Surprise Engine
- SurpriseStore: SQLite-backed CRUD, resolve, count_unresolved, get_unresolved
- Scorer: pattern-matching scoring (no match=0.7, violated=0.5+conf×0.5, low freq=0.2, high freq=0.0)
- Auto-score via `auto_score` flag on create (routes through scorer with pattern store)
- `GET /v1/host/surprises/unresolved` for high-score unresolved surprises

### Integration
- Context assembly: surprises section at priority 75 (between affect 80 and shared facts 70)
- Autonomy: `surprise_accumulation` condition (30min interval, fires when 5+ unresolved in 1h)
- Events: `pattern.created`, `pattern.extracted`, `surprise.high`, `surprise.accumulation`
- TypeScript client + types + config + cache channels
- 38 new unit tests (158 total)

## 0.4.0 (2026-04-22)

Theory of Mind v0.1: affect tracking and shared facts.

### Affect Tracking
- AffectStore: per-contact emotional valence (-1.0 to 1.0) and arousal (0.0 to 1.0)
- Exponential decay toward neutral (5% per hour, configurable)
- Trend detection: improving, declining, stable
- Negative spike detection (valence <= -0.5)
- Sustained decline detection (3+ events with declining trend)
- Context assembly injection: Emotional Context section (priority 80)
- Autonomy: affect_decline check every 30min
- Events: affect.event_created, affect.negative_spike, affect.sustained_decline
- API: POST /affect/events, GET /affect/state/{id}, GET /affect/history/{id}, DELETE /affect/events/{id}

### Shared Facts
- SharedFactsStore: what the agent believes each contact knows
- Fact categories: told_by_contact, told_to_contact, shared_context, inferred
- Confidence scores (0.0-1.0), TTL expiry, expired fact purging
- Context assembly injection: Shared Knowledge section (priority 70)
- Event: mind.fact_created
- API: POST /mind/facts, GET /mind/facts, GET /mind/facts/{id}, PATCH /mind/facts/{id}, DELETE /mind/facts/{id}

## 0.3.0 (2026-04-21)

Cognition substrate, commitment tracking, LLM compression tier 3, and native tool fixes.

### Cognition Substrate
- Commitment Store: SQLite-backed CRUD, status transitions (pending/fulfilled/cancelled/broken), overdue detection, delete guard (cancel first)
- Context Assembly: Pending Commitments section (priority 72) injected per contact
- Cognition Prompt + Trigger: `POST /v1/host/cognition/trigger`, throttle, `cognition.requested` event
- Trigger Pipeline: turn sync + signal ingest auto-fire cognition triggers (non-blocking)
- Config: `COLONY_COGNITION_ENABLED` (default false), `COLONY_COGNITION_MODEL`, `COLONY_COGNITION_THROTTLE_SECONDS` (default 30)
- Config: `COLONY_COMMITMENTS_ENABLED` (default true), `COLONY_COMMITMENT_CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 30)

### LLM Compression Tier 3
- `compress_sections_with_llm()` async wrapper for aggressive mode
- Falls back to sync tight-truncation on any LLM error
- Automatically used when `_llm_router` is wired and mode is aggressive

### DIGEST Delivery Channel
- `build_digest_bundle()`, `consume_digest()`, `flush_digests_to_gateway()`
- Scheduled daily via autonomy scheduler (configurable interval)
- Config: `COLONY_DIGEST_HEADER`, `COLONY_DIGEST_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 86400)

### LLM Entity Extractor
- Fallback for ExtractionPipeline when format extractors return nothing
- Bounded input (12K chars) and output (1024 tokens), JSON-only parsing
- Graceful degradation: returns empty list on any failure

### Fixes
- Native tool registration: register `.execute` methods instead of class instances (critical bug, tools were uncallable)
- ToolExecutor.get_definitions: only advertise tools with registered handlers
- execute_batch: JSON-serialize dict/list results instead of str()
- list_research endpoint: call pipeline instead of returning empty list
- Duplicate `set_commitment_store` import removed
- `.gitignore`: added `sidecar/events/`

## 0.2.0 (2026-04-21)

Security hardening, event journal, and adaptive context compression.

### Security
- Auth: `hmac.compare_digest` for API key checks (timing-attack resistant)
- `/v1/host/configure` blocked in dev mode (no COLONY_API_KEY)
- Body size limit middleware (10MB default, configurable)
- WebSocket frame size cap (1MB default)
- Subprocess-isolated skill sandbox with `setrlimit` guards (mem/CPU/fds/nproc)
- AST scanner: ESC001 (dunder escape chains), ESC002 (dynamic getattr/setattr)
- Rate limiter: SQLite-persisted delivery counts, crashloop-safe
- PII: hashed contact data in logs, no raw PII in error messages
- Neo4j: property allowlist on `update_person`, generated per-install password
- Docker Compose: requires `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, no default fallback

### Event Journal + Replay
- Append-only file-per-event journal with atomic writes and SHA-256 checksums
- `GET /v1/host/events/replay?since=&limit=&types=` endpoint
- WebSocket reconnect with `lastEventId` for replaying missed events
- Plugin tracks `lastEventTimestamp` across reconnects
- Bounded retention (default 500 events, configurable)

### Adaptive Context Compression
- Three modes: off (default), conservative, balanced, aggressive
- Tier 1: Drop low-relevance sections (query-aware F1 scoring)
- Tier 2: Sentence-boundary-aware truncation
- Tier 3: Tight truncation (LLM summarization placeholder for future)
- Per-request override via API field, plugin config setting

## 0.1.0 (2026-04-16)

First release with all adapter shapes matching the real OpenClaw SDK contracts.

### Adapters

- **MemoryPluginCapability** — `promptBuilder` (auto-inject instructions with citation hints) + `MemoryPluginRuntime` (`ColonyMemorySearchManager` backed by `/v1/host/memory/*` endpoints; `search`, `readFile`, `status`, `sync`, `probeEmbeddingAvailability`, `probeVectorAvailability`). Gated by `ownMemoryCapability` config flag (exclusive slot).
- **MemoryEmbeddingProviderAdapter** — `create()` factory with explicit `{provider: null}` when sidecar has no embedder. `embedQuery`/`embedBatch` delegate to `/v1/host/memory/embed` with 64-input chunking. Errors propagate (no silent zero-vectors).
- **ContextEngine** — `info` + `ingest` (no-op) + `assemble` (calls `/v1/host/context/assemble`, folds sections into `systemPromptAddition`) + `compact` (delegated to OpenClaw runtime via `delegateCompactionToRuntime`). `ownsCompaction: false`.
- **AgentHarness** — `supports()` with 3-layer gate (config flag + runtime match + capability probe), `runAttempt()` that never throws (always returns shaped `EmbeddedRunAttemptResult` with `promptError` on failure for harness-fallback routing), `reset` + `dispose` hooks. Currently 501 because reasoning endpoint isn't wired yet (Stage B).
- **Safety hook** (`message_sending`) — fail-closed by default (`failSafetyClosed: true`). Per-chunk safety with capability gating. Never throws out of the handler.
- **Post-turn hook** (`reply_dispatch`) — fire-and-forget observer via `Promise.allSettled`. Sends `signals/ingest` + `turns/sync` concurrently. Never takes over dispatch.
- **Events lifecycle service** — WebSocket subscriber with first-message auth, diagnostic `summarizeHostEvent` logging, error boundary per frame.

### Infrastructure

- `ColonySidecarClient` — typed HTTP/WS client with one method per `/v1/host/*` endpoint, AbortSignal support on `reasoningTurn`, first-message WebSocket auth.
- `capabilityProbe` — single-flight lazy probe with `has()`, `hasProbedSuccessfully()`, `snapshot()` (synchronous accessor for `supports()`), auto-reset on failure.
- `withDegradation` — shared error taxonomy (501/5xx → fallback, 4xx → re-throw, network → fallback).
- `ColonyApiError`, `ColonyEmbedUnavailableError` — typed errors.
- `summarizeHostEvent` — diagnostic log formatter with safe default (no payload leak on unknown types).
- Zod-validated config schema with `failSafetyClosed`, `ownMemoryCapability`, `ownReasoningLoop` flags.

### Tests

- 116 unit tests across 8 test files.
- 13 integration tests against a live colony-core sidecar (gated by `COLONY_SMOKE_URL` env var).

### Type safety

- Real `OpenClawPluginApi` imported from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry` (not a structural stub).
- Zero `@ts-expect-error` markers — every `register*` / `on` call type-checks against the SDK.
- SDK types derived via `Parameters<...>` / `Awaited<ReturnType<...>>` where public exports aren't available.

## 0.0.1 (2026-04-14)

Initial scaffold. Adapter shapes did not match the real SDK contracts. Superseded by 0.1.0.

## 0.1.1 (2026-04-21)

### Added
- Context engine slot: `plugins.slots.contextEngine = "colony"` auto-configured by setup wizard and documented in README
- Setup wizard now starts the sidecar, verifies health, checks LLM credentials, offers gateway restart, and runs `colony doctor`
- Node.js/npm guard in wizard — warns if missing before attempting plugin build
- Full identity awareness through Colony's context engine (colony_id, node_id, trust_tier, Genesis status)
- 22 E2E integration tests covering all subsystems (30 passed, 1 skipped in latest run)

### Changed
- Naming cleanup: "safety" → "response gate" / "content classifier" across codebase
- Setup wizard renumbered: 11 steps (was 10), now includes start + verify + doctor
- README updated to reflect hardened wizard flow — one `colony init` and you're done

### Fixed
- 25+ API router bugfixes (method names, constructors, type coercion, sync/await mismatches)
- VectorStore wiring: explicit `connect(dimensions)` + `ensure_collections()` after graph init
- GoalStore persistence: `:memory:` → `colony-goals.db`
- ResponseGate L1: passes when no session context (direct API calls)
- API key auth middleware added (was completely missing)

## 0.1.2 (2026-04-21)

### Changed
- Renamed PyPI package from `colony-sidecar` to `colonyai` for naming consistency across all registries
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING to reflect `pip install colonyai`
