# Colony ⇄ Hermes integration ops add-ons (generic, host-side)

These are **generic** add-ons that make a Colony cognitive sidecar robust on a
Hermes agent host — not specific to any single agent. They live host-side under
`~/.hermes/` (which survives Hermes updates) and are the building blocks the
Colony setup wizard installs/validates.

| File | Installs to | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `colony-doctor.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Validates the deployed Hermes↔Colony integration. STATIC: every plugin's registered hook names are checked against the running Hermes build's `VALID_HOOKS`; hook callbacks must be **sync** (Hermes invokes them as `cb(**kwargs)` and drops un-awaited coroutines) and accept `**kwargs`; tool handlers must absorb `**kwargs`; flags `ctx.config` / `register_slash_command`. LIVE: sidecar reachable, contact-resolve answers, Colony LLM is a generative (non-embedding) provider. Exits non-zero on any failure. |
| `colony-doctor-cron.sh` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Runs the doctor; alerts the WhatsApp **home/ops channel** only on a regression **or a Hermes version change** (the doctor records the last-seen version in `~/.hermes/.colony_doctor_state.json`). |
| `ai.aevonix.colony-doctor.plist` | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` | launchd job: runs the doctor at load + every 6h. |
| `hermes-patch-runner.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Registry runner for guarded, idempotent patches to the Hermes framework source (the only sanctioned way to alter framework behavior beyond config/plugins/hooks). `status` verifies without touching anything, `apply` heals after a framework update, and anchors that drifted report FUNDAMENTAL_CHANGE instead of blind-patching. Patch definitions are deployment-specific and belong in your private deployment repo (registry dir: `~/.hermes/patches/`); see `PATCHES.md` for the contract. The doctor invokes `apply --json` on every run. |
| `hermes-gateway-restart-runner.sh` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Robust gateway restart (bootout-wait + bootstrap-retry + bridge-wait). Writes a pre-restart resume marker and posts the restart notice to the **home/ops channel** (never the owner's main chat). |
| `pre-restart-summary.py` | `~/.hermes/scripts/` | Captures the last exchange + recent (deduped) tools + Colony timeline digest into `~/.hermes/.post_restart_resume` so the agent resumes context after a restart. |

## Why the doctor exists

Hermes invokes plugin hooks **synchronously** as `cb(**kwargs)` and injects any
returned `{"context": str}` into the user turn. Several failure modes are
**silent** — no error, the hook just never fires:

- an `async def` hook → returns an un-awaited coroutine that is dropped
- a hook registered under a name not in this build's `VALID_HOOKS` (e.g.
  `agent:start`) → dropped with only a one-line WARNING at load
- a hook/tool handler whose signature can't absorb the kwargs Hermes passes
  (`sender_id`, `task_id`, …) → raises and is swallowed

The doctor catches all of these statically, and re-runs automatically when the
Hermes version changes — so a Hermes upgrade that shifts hook conventions is
surfaced immediately instead of silently degrading Colony.

Convention status as of Hermes v0.18.0 (v2026.7.1): verified UNCHANGED. Hooks
are still sync `cb(**kwargs)`; `pre_llm_call` still receives `sender_id` and
now also `task_id`, `turn_id`, `conversation_history`, `is_first_turn`,
`model`, `platform`; `{"context": str}` returns still inject into the user
message. New at 0.18 (not used by this plugin yet): the `pre_verify` hook, the
`kanban_task_*` lifecycle hooks, a middleware layer (`register_middleware`)
for payload rewriting, and a `plugins.entries.<id>.allow_tool_override` trust
gate for `register_tool(override=True)` (we register no overrides). See
`docs/ROADMAP-COGNITION.md`, "Hermes integration", for the full capability map.

## Install

```bash
cp colony-doctor.py colony-doctor-cron.sh hermes-gateway-restart-runner.sh \
   hermes-patch-runner.py pre-restart-summary.py ~/.hermes/scripts/
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/patches   # deployment patch registry (definitions come from your private repo)
cp ai.aevonix.colony-doctor.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.aevonix.colony-doctor.plist
~/.hermes/scripts/colony-doctor.py   # run once
```

Override the plugins dir for testing: `COLONY_DOCTOR_PLUGINS_DIR=/path ./colony-doctor.py`.

## Tool-activity stream (meaningful ops-channel lines)

The general plugin's `pre_tool_call` hook records a friendly one-line summary of
*what each tool call is doing* (the shell command, the file path, the search
query, the colony verb+args) to `~/.hermes/.tool_activity.jsonl` — generic, any
agent. `colony-activity-monitor.py` (a reference consumer) enriches each home-channel
line with it, so a muted ops channel still reads as meaningful actions:

```
↳ session · ⚡ shell · date · 0.03s · 73 chars
↳ session · 📖 read · ~/.hermes/config.yaml · 0.09s · 264 chars
↳ session · 🔧 colony_list_goals · list goals: active · 0.02s · 13 chars
```
