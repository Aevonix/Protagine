"""The supervised-live rung, generically (H1.1).

The trust ladder has a structural catch-22: graduation ask_first ->
act_first requires a REAL (non-shadow) track record, but a domain that only
acts at act_first never produces one. The beliefs engine solved this for
itself (U26) with a domain-specific flag; this module is the same rung for
ANY domain, so every future consumer shares one definition of "supervised"
instead of growing private variants.

The rung: at trust stage ask_first, a domain listed in
COLONY_SUPERVISED_LIVE_DOMAINS (comma-separated, default EMPTY = rung off
everywhere) may perform REVERSIBLE operations only, journaled, with
outcomes recorded shadow=False — building exactly the track record
graduation needs. Destructive operations still require the full "live"
mode (act_first stage or explicit env override).

What counts as reversible is NOT the caller's judgment call: it is pinned
in ``REVERSIBLE_CONTRACT`` below, and ``reversible()`` fails CLOSED — an
unknown domain or an unlisted operation is non-reversible, full stop.
Trust-engine errors likewise degrade to the plain env mode (never upward).

Legacy alias: COLONY_BELIEFS_SUPERVISED_LIVE=1 still enables the rung for
the beliefs domain (the live deployments that set it keep working).
