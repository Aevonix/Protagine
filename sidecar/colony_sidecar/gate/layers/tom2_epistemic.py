"""tom2_epistemic — the egress net under leveled cross-contact tom2 (L3.2).

When a level-2 epistemic line is injected into a conversation's context,
the wiring registers a TAINT (gate/taint.py, TTL'd). While any taint is
live, this check hard-blocks a reply that:

  (a) names a tainted SUBJECT inside an epistemic-claim pattern
      ("knows / doesn't know / hasn't heard / unaware / no idea /
      don't tell / keep it from / hasn't been told") — voicing the
      silent prior is the T4 elicitation leak;
  (b) makes a self-referential modeling claim ("I track what people
      know", "epistemic prior", ...) — narrating THAT the system models
      people is itself a disclosure while a prior is hot;
  (c) carries a tainted fact's TEXT (resolved from the fact ref at check
      time, never stored) toward a DIFFERENT conversation than the one
      the taint was registered for — injected content spilling contexts.

INERT BY CONSTRUCTION: with no active taint the check answers [] after a
single in-memory clock comparison (TaintRegistry.any_active watermark) —
zero cost and zero false positives for every turn that never saw a level-2
injection. That inertness is why this check ships on the DEFAULT enforce
allowlist from day one: it cannot block anything until the level-2 flip
(L4.2) actually registers taints.

HONEST LIMITATION (test-documented): (a) and (b) are lexical. A paraphrase
("Bob is still in the dark about it") escapes them. The structural
guarantees live UPSTREAM — the renderer can only inject fact text the
reader already owns — so an escape here leaks phrasing pressure, not new
content. This net narrows the residual, it does not close it.
