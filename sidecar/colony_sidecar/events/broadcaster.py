"""Shared lazy-broadcast helper for sidecar subsystems.

Subsystems (consolidator, goal store, briefing store, world-model store,
skills registry) call ``emit(type, payload)`` to push a typed event to
all connected WebSocket subscribers. The import of ``broadcast_event``
is lazy so modules that want to emit events don't take a hard dependency
on the API router.

Errors are swallowed — event emission must never break the subsystem
that triggers it.
