# Apsimo diagnostics

1. Run `apsimo status` and `apsimo doctor`. Read the reported endpoint and instance
   instead of assuming a directory, machine, port, or database backend.
2. For coding harnesses, run `apsimo mcp detect`. Confirm one `apsimo` MCP server
   is configured. Legacy `colony` entries are migrated by `apsimo mcp setup --harness <name>`.
3. Call `apsimo_health`. If it fails, report the actual transport or authentication
   error. Use the selected instance's credential reference; never guess a key,
   print its value, or dump a whole configuration into a transcript.
4. If health passes, use `apsimo_get_context` for the authenticated contact and
   `apsimo_lookup_facts` for a known source-backed fact. Report what was actually
   retrieved. Do not insert test facts into ordinary memory.
5. For Hermes, inspect its selected profile's plugin and memory-provider status.
   Correct the indicated connection or configuration, then repeat the failed
   probe once. A successful HTTP request alone does not prove useful recollection.

Apsimo is the platform's new name; the agent or another private agent keeps its own
identity. Existing state paths and COLONY_* variables remain supported. Conflicting
explicit APSIMO_* and COLONY_* settings must be resolved at configuration load.
