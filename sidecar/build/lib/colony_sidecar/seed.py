COLONY_IDENTITY = """
Colony is an intelligence infrastructure system for AI agents. It provides a modular 
intelligence layer that can be mounted into any agent framework (OpenClaw, Hermes, etc.) 
via a clean HTTP API.

Colony consists of two deployable units:
1. Plugin (TypeScript) — Loads into the host agent's process, registers hooks and adapters
2. Sidecar (Python/FastAPI) — Standalone intelligence server with 20 subsystems

The plugin and sidecar are coupled only by HTTP contract. Python Pydantic schemas define 
all request/response types, which generate an OpenAPI spec, which generates TypeScript types.
This ensures zero drift between client and server.

Colony's core purpose: Give agents persistent memory, context assembly, safety filtering, 
goal tracking, and proactive delivery through a single unified API.

Colony runs as a sidecar service alongside your agent. The agent (OpenClaw, Hermes, etc.) 
loads a thin TypeScript plugin that registers hooks and adapters with the host framework.

When the agent needs intelligence (memory search, context assembly, safety check, etc.), 
the plugin makes HTTP calls to the sidecar's /v1/host/* endpoints.

The sidecar maintains connections to:
- Neo4j (graph memory storage)
- SQLite (contacts, goals, world model)
- LiteLLM (LLM routing and inference)

All 20 intelligence subsystems are managed by SubsystemRegistry, which provides lazy
initialization and shared resource access.

Communication flow:
  User message → Agent → Plugin hooks → Sidecar API → Intelligence subsystems → Neo4j/SQLite/LLM

The sidecar is stateless between requests — all state lives in Neo4j, SQLite, or the LLM.
Session context is passed with each request via identity and context fields.""",

Before every LLM turn, OpenClaw calls the ContextEngine.assemble() method registered 
by the Colony plugin. This triggers the context assembly pipeline:

1. Plugin extracts the incoming user message from the conversation
2. Plugin calls /v1/host/context/enriched on the sidecar
3. Sidecar queries 6 subsystems in parallel:
   - Memory: Top 5 relevant memories via vector search
   - Contact: Relationship profile and trust tier
   - Style: Communication style preferences
   - Goals: Active goals for this contact
   - World Model: Relevant entities (people, places, concepts)
   - Insights: Recently discovered connections
4. Sidecar assembles results into ContextSection objects
5. Plugin formats sections as system prompt addition
6. LLM receives enriched context alongside the conversation

This happens automatically before every turn. The agent doesn't need to explicitly
request context — Colony injects it transparently.

Colony's memory is backed by Neo4j, a graph database that models:
- Memories (episodic content with timestamps)
- Entities (people, places, organizations, concepts)
- Relationships (entity-to-entity, memory-to-entity)

Memory retrieval uses hybrid search:
1. Vector search: Embed query → ANN search in LanceDB → Get top-k memory IDs
2. Graph hydration: Fetch full Memory nodes from Neo4j with linked entities
3. Strength decay: Apply Ebbinghaus forgetting curve — older/unused memories lose weight
4. Relevance scoring: final_score = vector_similarity × memory_strength

Memories are automatically reinforced when recalled (touch_memory operation).
This means frequently accessed memories stay strong, while unused ones fade.

The graph structure enables multi-hop queries:
- "What did we discuss about PROJECT?"
- "Who is mentioned in conversations about TOPIC?"
- "What entities are connected to PERSON?"

Memory operations:
- /memory/write — Store a new memory with auto-extracted entities

Layer 3: Cross-context detection — Prevents information bleeding between unrelated sessions
Layer 4: Trust tier checking — Enforces trust-level boundaries per contact
Layer 5: Injection detection — Catches prompt injection artifacts in LLM output
Layer 6: Secondary review — Optional second-pass LLM review for suspicious outputs
Layer 7: Send delay — Configurable hold window allowing cancellation before dispatch

Each layer can PASS or BLOCK. Layers 1–5 short-circuit on first block.
Per-contact bypass overrides are supported (except Layer 1 which is always enforced).
